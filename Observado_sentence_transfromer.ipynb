Now in interstellar space, the area beyond the magnetic bubble inflated by our Sun, Voyager\\'s data is revealing what that new frontier is like.\\n\\nA study published in Nature Astronomy reports what may be the first continuous measurement of the density of material in interstellar space. “This detection offers us a new way to measure the density of interstellar space and opens up a new pathway for us to explore the structure of the very nearby interstellar medium,” said Stella Ocker, a Ph.D. student at Cornell University and part of the Voyager team.\\n\\nThe Voyager mission crossed the heliosphere’s (the bubble formed by our Sun) boundary on August 25, 2012, becoming the first human-made object to enter and measure interstellar space. While the new measurements are an insight into the zone beyond our Solar System, scientists believe that over time, the heliosphere’s presence will fade from Voyager\\'s measurements completely.\\n\\nAlso Read: Nasa\\'s Osiris-Rex begins 2-year trip home with samples from asteroid Bennu\\n\\nNasa in a statement said, \"If our heliosphere is a ship sailing interstellar waters, Voyager-1 is a life raft just dropped from the deck, determined to survey the currents. For now, any rough waters it feels are mostly from our heliosphere’s wake. But farther out, it will sense the stirrings from sources deeper in the cosmos.\"\\n\\nVoyager continues to hear whistle pings on its journey that it first heard in November 2012, the whistles were interpreted as density data of interstellar space, on an annual basis. “They\\'ve only been seen about once a year, so relying on these kinds of fortuitous events meant that our map of the density of interstellar space was kind of sparse,” Ocker said.\\n\\nAlso Read: Flying on Mars is possible: Here\\'s how small rotorcraft Ingenuity proved it\\n\\nIn a bid to speed up the process, Ocker set out to find a running measure of interstellar medium density to fill in the gaps one that doesn’t depend on the occasional shockwaves propagating out from the Sun. After filtering through Voyager-1’s data, looking for weak but consistent signals, she found a promising candidate.\\n\\n“It’s virtually a single tone,” said Ocker. “And over time, we do see it change but the way the frequency moves around tells us how the density is changing,” Nasa quoted her as saying. The new signal termed as plasma wave emission rises and falls when the abrupt whistles appeared in the data.\\n\\nThe signal also resembles one observed in Earth’s upper atmosphere that’s known to track with the electron density there.\\n\\nScientists are now working on developing a physical model of how the plasma wave emission is produced.',\n",

The black fish, which appears rather frightening at first glance, laid on the sand on the shore of Crystal Cove State Park's Marine Protected Area in Laguna Beach last Friday.\\n\\nIn a post on Facebook, Crystal Cove State Park shared pictures of the fish and other details after the rare creature was spotted. It is most likely the Pacific Football Fish, the post said, adding that their teeth are transparent, “like pointed shards of glass.”\\n\\n“Last Friday morning an incredible deep sea fish washed up on shore in Crystal Cove State Park’s Marine Protected Area (MPA). There are more than 200 species of angler fish worldwide and this particular fish is most likely the Pacific Football Fish. Only females possess a long stalk on the head with bioluminescent tips used as a lure to entice prey in the darkness of waters as deep as 3,000 feet! Their teeth, like pointed shards of glass, are transparent and their large mouth is capable of sucking up and swallowing prey the size of their own body,” the post reads.\\n\\nThis is a rare sight, Crystal Cove State Park said, adding that, “Seeing this strange and fascinating fish is a testament to the diversity of marine life lurking below the water’s surface in California’s MPAs and as scientists continue to learn more about these deep sea creatures it’s important to reflect on how much is still to be learned from our wonderful ocean.”\\n\\n“While females can reach lengths of 24 inches males only grow to be about an inch long and their sole purpose is to find a female and help her reproduce. Males latch onto the female with their teeth and become “sexual parasites,” eventually coalescing with the female until nothing is left of their form but their testes for reproduction. Wild! To see an actual angler fish intact is very rare and it is unknown how or why the fish ended up on the shore,” the post reads.\\n\\nSee pictures here:\\n\\nThe Football Fish form a family, Himantolophidae, of deep-sea angler fishes found in tropical and subtropical waters of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Ocean.\\n\\nALSO READ: New York cops help ducklings reunite with their mother.

              " 'Reading to children should not be a chore. But the pleasure a child gets from a book is lost if they do not understand the language.\\n\\nIt’s a problem faced by parents worldwide, not least in Arabic, where children’s books are written in a formal standard so distinct from their spoken tongue. But a handful of pioneers are now making headway.\\n\\nRiham Shendy, 45, started translating popular English-language storybooks into Egyptian Arabic after she had her twins, Ali and Leila, in 2013. An economist by profession and with a PhD in Applied Economics, she was working at the World Bank in Washington DC when she and her German husband, Steffen Reichold, decided to teach their son and daughter their respective mother tongues.\\n\\nSome popular children’s books have been translated into classical Arabic, like Julia Donaldson’s The Gruffalo and The Very Hungry Caterpillar, by Eric Carle. But it is rare to find them in a’amiya, the commonly spoken dialects of the language: even the names of the foods that Carle’s caterpillar munches his way through do not correspond to the vocabulary that parents teach their children.\\n\\nSome children\\'s books are already available in Arabic translations, including this bilingual edition of The Very Hungry Caterpillar, by Eric Carle, translated by Sonia El-Nimr (Mantra Lingua Publishing)\\n\\nInstead, the collection of Arabic children’s books that Shendy had proudly amassed were in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) or Fusha, a formal version mostly used in official communication, documentation and literature.\\n\\nThe language spoken across the Middle East and North Africa is a dialect of this form, unique to each country. Regional variations in vocabulary and grammar mean it is sometimes incomprehensible across borders.\\n\\nThere is no quicker way to suck all the fun out of reading than simultaneously translating each story page from formal Arabic into colloquial Arabic\\n\\nAt first, says Shendy, reading to her children was straightforward: “At the beginning you open a book, it’s just an apple here, a banana there. Fine.”\\n\\nBut once the twins were around 18 months old, life became trickier. There is no quicker way to suck all the fun out of reading than simultaneously translating each story page from formal Arabic into colloquial Arabic.\\n\\n“I am fluent in classical Arabic, I was brought up in Egypt,” Shendy says. “The minute you have something in Fusha rhyme and you’re translating word for word, you’re changing the structure of the sentence, you’re changing the words, you lose the rhyme.\"\\n\\nThis, she says, is why the Dr Seuss books are so helpful for children – because they help them understand the sound structure of language.\\n\\n“Sometimes I’d forget to say something and they’re like: ‘But you didn’t say that he was sad’... Oh yeah, well it’s because I made that up when I was translating last time.”\\n\\nTo avoid being caught out again, Shendy translated some of her children’s favourite stories into colloquial Egyptian, painstakingly preserving the rhythm and rhyme. She then printed out her translations and glued them over the English in the book.\\n\\nFive or six books later, in November 2016, Shendy posted her translations on a website, which she called Tuta Tuta, after an Egyptian phrase traditionally used to end a story. As the website’s popularity grew, so she started to play around with the format, posting videos of her reading the stories, as well as offering downloadable audio files.\\n\\nBut the process was becoming tiresome. Shendy tried to make contact with publishers to see if they would consider printing books in Arabic dialects.\\n\\n“I was running out of books,” she recalls. “I can\\'t create a book every time I want to read the book. I wrote to Macmillan, I wrote to Ladybird. Nobody answered me. Of course - I’m no one.”\\n\\nThe unspoken struggle\\n\\nShendy decided that there was only one thing for her to do: go it alone. A self-professed nerd, and thanks to her academic background, she spent 10 months collating research to support her proposal. The result was the academic paper The Limitations of Reading to Young Children in Literary Arabic.\\n\\n“Ample research has shown that the benefits of reading aloud to young children extend far beyond developing their literacy skills,” Shendy wrote, referring to “speakers within a single community (nation) [who] simultaneously use two varieties of Arabic... Reading to children has a rich role in enhancing their emotional, social, and cognitive development.”\\n\\nRiham Shendy reads to her twins from her new book, Kan Yama Kan (Riham Shendy)\\n\\nAlthough her paper was then published by an academic journal, it didn’t move her any further forward. In March 2019, she pitched a storybook to Egyptian publishers. But they were not interested in publishing something that they wouldn’t be able to market to the rest of the region.\\n\\nMarcia Lynx Qualey, a translator of Arabic children’s literature and co-founder of the World Kid Lit project, says that children\\'s publishers are in a difficult position.\\n\\n\\'Arab children are asked to surmount obstacles that no other children in the world are asked to do\\' - Niloofar Haeri, linguistic anthropologist\\n\\n“They may want to publish books in a’amiya, but they also want to sell into as large a market as possible. This means being able to sell across borders, particularly into wealthier Gulf countries, but it also means selling to schools and libraries. Generally, it\\'s only the books entirely in Fusha that are seen as ‘properly’ educational.”\\n\\nIn this respect, Arab readers have it tough: they need to learn both forms of the language and switch between the two - even if they haven’t yet learnt to read or write by themselves.\\n\\nNiloofar Haeri, a linguistic anthropologist at John Hopkins University, wrote in 2003 in Sacred Language, Ordinary People, that \"Arab children are asked to surmount obstacles that no other children in the world are asked to do - namely, learn their subjects while lacking proficiency in the language in which those subjects are written.\"\\n\\nIn April, Shendy self-published Kan Yama Kan (Once Upon A Time), an anthology of eight popular children’s stories, all in her translation. Tales like Mika al-Ahmarika and the Wolf (Little Red Riding Hood) are not only retold in Egyptian dialect but also given the cultural dressing that helps teach children about their heritage.\\n\\nShendy\\'s version of Little Red Riding Hood is based in the Egyptian oasis city of Fayoum (Illustration by Basma Hosam)\\n\\nIn Shendy’s version, Mika (Red Riding Hood) carries a fiteer (an Egyptian crepe) instead of a pie, to her poorly grandmother, who lives in the oasis city of Fayoum near Egypt’s only waterfall in Wadi al-Rayyan.\\n\\nShendy included fun facts to generate talking points with young children, as well as introduce concepts like the environment.\\n\\nWhile wolves aren’t common to Egypt, she set the tale in Fayoum after she discovered that one had been found and released there in 2018 by the Ministry of Environment.\\n\\nLikewise, her version of The Ugly Duckling is set in the Upper Egyptian city of Sohag, where the duck hides among the sugar cane plantations; the women in the Magic Belila Pot wear Bedouin clothing and put belila wheat cereal in the pot instead of porridge; and in her version of The Three Little Pigs, based in the western desert, the wolf falls into a huge bowl of green molokhia, a jute leaf stew.\\n\\nShendy\\'s version of The Gingerbread Man is set in Cairo (Illustration by Aia Sharawy)\\n\\n“I didn’t start off knowing that I’m going to do different governorates but I needed to add a depth,” Shendy says. “So you’re not just listening again to Little Red Riding Hood, you’re going to listen to her now in Fayoum with her mum looking like a typical Fayoum mum.”\\n\\nEven Cairo makes an appearance halfway through the compendium, as the gingerbread man races throughout the capital before ultimately being gobbled up against the dramatic backdrop of the pyramids.\\n\\nPublishing in the Arab world\\n\\nIn 2012, Palestinian journalist Reem Makhoul relocated to New York with her husband, Stephen Farrell. Originally from Galilee, she, like Shendy, eventually shifted gears and took a career break when she had Sheherazade, her first child.\\n\\nWith Farrell being Irish, the onus was on Makhoul to introduce their daughter to the Arabic language and the identity she held so dear.\\n\\n“I want my daughter to know the language of her music, her food, her culture, her clothes, the conversations in the village. You know, her grandparents, the plants we plant in the ground,\" Makhoul says.\\n\\n\"I want her to be able to communicate with them in their own language, and actually her own language because she is half Palestinian.”\\n\\nMakhoul and her husband set up a publishing house to produce their own stories in spoken Arabic dialects (Reem Makhoul)\\n\\nOne night in 2014, Makhoul was reading a bedtime story to Sheherazade, who was then nearly four.\\n\\n“I started reading books in Arabic for her that friends and family brought to me from Palestine and Lebanon and Jordan,\" she says. But Makhoul missed the flow of Arabic storytelling.\\n\\n\"I had to read the story in Fusha in my head, each page, and then translate it into colloquial Arabic so that she understood the spoken Arabic words. It really bothered me. It didn\\'t feel natural. It cut the flow for me and for her.”\\n\\nLike Shendy, Makhoul faced the same problem: there were no suitable Arabic-language children’s books. Like Shendy, she took the DIY approach - but instead of reworking an existing book, she decided to make her own.\\n\\n\\u200bWhere Shall I Hide? was published by Ossass Stories in both Levantine and Egyptian Arabic editions (Ossass Stories) \\u200b\\n\\nOne night, after putting their daughter to bed, Makhoul told her husband: “I know exactly what we need to do. We need to write stories for children in colloquial Arabic.”\\n\\nThe couple set up a publishing house they named Ossass Stories (Ossass means \"stories\" in Levantine dialect), learning the trade from scratch and financing it themselves. Makhoul would work by day as a journalist and then research the publishing industry by night, drawing up cost analyses and searching for illustrators and distribution outlets.\\n\\n“I was so excited that I felt like we were meant to do this,\" she says, recalling how she would stay up until three in the morning researching books written in colloquial Arabic.\\n\\n“I was so surprised that I didn\\'t find any because I thought: ‘I am so sure that there are so many people like me out there who totally thought about this, who totally went through this same process like me, but how come there aren\\'t any books like this?’”\\n\\nThe first book they published in 2015 was The Girl Who Lost Her Imagination. Set in New York, it was inspired by Sheherazade’s own active imagination and written in the Levantine dialect.\\n\\nSince then, the family have moved to Jerusalem. Ossass Stories published a second book, Where Shall I Hide? in 2017: both are now available in Levantine and Egyptian Arabic.\\n\\n“If I teach my daughter Arabic, it\\'s a gift for life. She will have more cultural and professional opportunities later on in the future,” Makhoul says. \"I just want her to speak to me in my own language, and for me to speak to her in my own language.\"\\n\\nSpeaking in ‘our words’\\n\\nThe problem with reading material for very young children learning Arabic is universal. But the lack of age-appropriate learning resources is felt more keenly by parents raising their children outside the region.\\n\\nSaussan Khalil, an Arabic language teacher at the University of Cambridge and a mother of two, says: \"You don\\'t have it around you. That\\'s where it\\'s such a problem for us outside of the Arabic speaking communities, that our kids are not exposed.\\n\\n\"They don\\'t pick it up at home. You can\\'t, the exposure is too little at home versus the [English] exposure at school.\"\\n\\nA dearth in Arabic learning resources is a problem for families and educators outside the Arab world (Saussan Khalil)\\n\\nBritish-Egyptian Khalil moved to Cambridge in 2014, when her first daughter Noura was two-and-a-half years old. Without an Egyptian community around them, she worried that Noura would never fully grasp her mother tongue.\\n\\nKhalil and her friend Mona El-Kheshen tried local Arabic groups for their young children, but found that the entry-level standard was too focused on writing for toddlers.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It was actually Mona who turned to me after that and said: ‘Saussan, you\\'re a teacher, teach [them] Arabic.\\' They say necessity is the mother of invention.”\\n\\nMore recently [Khalil] has introduced phonics-style learning... but the scarcity of resources for all ages continues to be a problem\\n\\nKhalil set up a small weekly group, initially with just her daughter, El-Kheshen\\'s two children and Khalil’s Spanish neighbour’s little girl, who was obsessed with ancient Egypt and wanted to learn the language.\\n\\nHer approach was unique, conducting classes wholly in vernacular Arabic.\\n\\nMore recently, she has introduced phonics-style learning: Kalamna (Arabic for “our words”) now caters for around 60 students, from baby to adult, including weekly sessions for Syrian children who have resettled in Cambridge and whose parents want them to retain their native language.\\n\\nBut the scarcity of resources for all ages continues to be a problem. “If it\\'s nursery rhymes and cartoons, and things like that, they’re all dubbed into Standard Arabic, it\\'s very frustrating.”\\n\\nKhalil\\'s (L) set up Kalamna Classes to help children like her daughter (R) learn Arabic (Saussan Khalil)\\n\\nHaving once described herself as “the reluctant entrepreneur”, Khalil now also delivers masterclasses to aspiring teachers for their own Kalamna-style sessions and recently launched her first franchise.\\n\\n“The problem is Standard Arabic isn\\'t spoken anywhere.” Khalil says. “It\\'s an ideological or theoretical standard. And so that\\'s where linguistically the problems occur and pedagogically, as well. You\\'re kind of creating artificial material and scenarios.”\\n\\nLearners, she says, then get disheartened, because they can\\'t use the language to speak to people.\\n\\n\"They get laughed at... it\\'s very frustrating for them.”\\n\\nThe Enormous Turnip\\n\\nIn 2016, Khalil contacted Makhoul after discovering Ossass Stories and ordering a copy of its first book. Later she spoke to Shendy about how to add her Arabic translations into English storybooks.\\n\\nKhalil recalls: \"It sounds really extreme now but I remember the strength of feeling at the time that I just want a book in Arabic! And I guess Riham had the exact same feeling, so that’s how she came up with the idea. And a beautiful friendship was born.\"\\n\\nFrom that point on, the three women communicated \"constantly\" Khalil says, mainly over email and social media. In February 2019 she set up The Spoken Arabic Initiative group on Facebook, as a forum to discuss projects, obstacles and \"find support and encouragement when we just felt like giving up\".\\n\\nThe three – based in the US, UK and the Middle East - finally met in person during summer 2019 when they discovered that they would all be in or near London at the same time.\\n\\n\"We felt like we’d known each other our whole lives and couldn’t believe we’d never physically met before,\" Khalil recalls.\\n\\nFrom Left to Right: Makhoul, Khalil and Shendy met for the first time in London\\'s Hyde Park in August 2019 (Reem Makhoul)\\n\\nThere, on a windy summer’s evening in London’s Hyde Park, they walked and shared stories and advice. That meeting also precipitated Shendy producing her own anthology.\\n\\nShendy recalls: “I was with Saussan last August and she told me: ‘Do the book…’ And I said: ‘I’m not doing the book. No one’s going to buy the book.\\'\"\\n\\n“We were screaming in Hyde Park, me, her and Reem... And then literally, the second week of September, I was like: ‘Okay, I’m doing the book\\'” - Riham Shendy\\n\\nIndeed, the three were so engrossed in conversation that they missed the closing of the park and found themselves locked in.\\n\\n“We were screaming in Hyde Park, me, her and Reem,” Shendy says. “And then literally, the second week of September, I was like: ‘Okay, I’m doing the book.’”\\n\\nAfter pushing her to take the leap, Khalil helped Shendy put more argument into her academic thinking of the project and Makhoul gave her advice on illustration, printing and distribution, based on her own experience. \"Reem helped a lot because she had the know-how.\"\\n\\nShendy’s book opens with an Egyptian adaptation of the Russian folk tale The Enormous Turnip, which seems to symbolise the struggle all three women faced. Ateya, a farmer, is helped by his family and some passing animals as, one by one, they harvest a giant turnip that grew from rows of tiny seeds he had planted.\\n\\nThen together they pulled and pulled, and the turnip suddenly flew out of the ground.\\n\\nFor the next month, whenever they were hungry, they would gather at the table, and eat from the turnip that they pulled out together from the soil\\n\\nShendy’s book has sold well in Egypt and shipping is now available to the US, with the rest of the world to follow soon. She has also started a video series on Facebook on the value of reading, based on cited scientific research.\\n\\nIn The Enormous Turnip, the smallest creatures turn out to help the farmer (Illustration by Dina Abd el Salam)\\n\\n“It\\'s really a cry for people to look at this,” Shendy says. “We need this and nobody wants to do it.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not saying we should do a\\'amiya [spoken Arabic] forever for everyone. I\\'m just saying for the little ones - they didn\\'t even go to school.\\n\\n“To me this book is about: Is anybody feeling the pain like me, or not?”\\n\\n“Kan Yama Kan (Once Upon a Time) – International Folktales in Egyptian Arabic”, is published by Tuta-tuta.com\\n\\n“The Girl who Lost Her Imagination” and “Where Shall I Hide?”, are available from Ossass Stories in Levantine and Egyptian Arabic editions\\n\\nKalamna classes, usually held in Cambridge and Newcastle, UK, are currently available online in response to safety regulations following the Covid-19 pandemic\\n\\nThis article is available in French on Middle East Eye French edition.',\n",

More than 1.7 million people worldwide have been killed by the virus so far and more than 77 million infected worldwide, according to the latest World Health Organisation figures.\\n\\nBillions of people have been forced to live under \"lockdown\" conditions as governments have struggled to contain the spread of the disease, causing economic devastation, social upheaval and unprecedented restrictions on international travel. Its impact will reverberate for years t0 come.\\n\\nIn the Middle East, Iran was particularly hard hit by the illness. Thriving social movements and political transitions across Sudan, Lebanon and Iraq were thrown into turmoil, while economic and political crises were exacerbated. Countries heavily reliant on oil and gas exports, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, have seen their revenues plummet with falling global demand.\\n\\nThe pandemic further accentuated the consequences of other events in the region, such as the assassination of Iranian commander Qassem Solimani in January, which brought Iran and the US to the brink of war, and the devastating August blast in Beirut that flattened much of the city and triggered new heights of anger against the country\\'s political class. Throughout it all, art, culture and flashes of hope sought to counter the underlying gloom.\\n\\nBelow, Middle East Eye journalists have selected the stories and articles they felt mattered in 2020 - and the reasons why.\\n\\nA small glimmer of hope for the country came last week when a nationwide ceasefire was declared by the Saudi-led coalition (Reuters)\\n\\nExtract: “In Europe, Covid-19 is killing thousands and they have good health systems, and people can buy food and stay at home, but in Yemen most Yemenis can’t stock-up food for a week.

In 2020 it claimed the lives of at least 6,000 troops from the warring sides as well as hundreds of civilian casualties.\\n\\nDuring the course of the weekend, Ragip broke the news that many in the region wanted to hear: a ceasefire had been reached. For me, this widely read piece captures Ragip\\'s ability to dig into the latest developing story and come up with gold - days before people know what is coming.\\n\\nIn the days following George Floyd\\'s killing, pictures of Israeli authorities taking similar positions over the necks of Palestinians have begun appearing across social media (Reuters)\\n\\nExtract: Since his death in late May, footage of Floyd pleading: \"I can\\'t breathe\" and \"they\\'re going to kill me,\" has emerged alongside videos and stills of Israeli security forces taking similar positions over the necks of unarmed Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the besieged Gaza Strip.\\n\\nDuring a macabre summer, when the world witnessed the life squeezed out of an African-American man by the knee of a white police officer, our US-based journalists were transfixed on the protests ravaging the US over George Floyd\\'s killing.\\n\\nTriggering a wave of activism that spread to more than 50 countries, Floyd\\'s brutal killing also thrust a lens on Israeli policing in the occupied Palestinian territories.\\n\\nSheren Khalel\\'s deep dive focused on the links between Israeli police forces and their US counterparts, and how those connections have shaped racial profiling, counter-terrorism and the suppression of protests.\\n\\nA Lebanese woman sits in her damaged bedroom in the damaged neighbourhood of Mar Mikhael in Beirut on 6 August (AFP)\\n\\nExtract: \"Around me, my living room exploded all at once.

Those memories hurt me sometimes. Make me depressed. Make me scared of so many things.”\\n\\nI was on the weekend shift, and a dreary eyed Mohamed Hassan, who was in New Zealand to cover the first anniversary of the attacks, had just sent me a message: he had written a story, and it needed to be sub-edited.\\n\\nI moaned. No one had told me I would be editing a story on my weekend shift.\\n\\nBut when I began reading his words, I broke down. Despite being thousands of miles away, the victims Mohamed described in his piece felt far too real. Sheikh Hasan Rubel, who was shot three times and is now confined to a chair unable to walk properly, reminded me of my dad. Hazem Mohammed, who played dead praying he wouldn\\'t be shot, reminded me of my uncle.\\n\\nMohamed\\'s long read was the most comprehensive piece I had read on the victims of the Christchurch mosque attack, which left 51 dead and many more injured in March 2019. His knowledge of New Zealand allowed the reader to know more about the local context and, more importantly, shed light on the dangers that right-wing rhetoric can have on ordinary people who can be both victims and perpetrators.\\n\\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (L) and Russian President Vladimir Putin are said to have shouted at each other during the call (AFP/Reuters/Illustration by Mohamad Elaasar)\\n\\nExtract: “\\'Just before that meeting there was a call between Putin and MBS.

Putin refused the ultimatum and the call ended badly,\\' the Saudi official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.”\\n\\nDavid\\'s report went beyond revealing the details of a tense and messy phone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman which triggered a short-lived oil price war in April.\\n\\nIt also lifted the lid on how two leaders communicated through back channels to cut deals. David also showed how US President Donald Trump and his close adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, were also part of the oil game.\\n\\nThis story stands as an important chapter in the annals of 21st-century authoritarian leaders and their power plays.\\n\\nErtugrul\\'s emphasis on fairness towards non-Muslims in the series appears to show what Islamic rule could look like. (TRT/illustration Mohamad Elaasar)\\n\\nExtract: \"The show is about Muslim history, Islamic ideals and resisting tyranny. Social codes and values are not just relatable, they are the norm and the standard; a self-contained universe of thought and practices, where Muslims are able to see themselves as heroes, villains, collaborators, and not as caricatures written by outsiders.\"\\n\\nIt was a strong year for content from Discover, Middle East Eye\\'s feature section. The best pieces, during such a harrowing year, were the most personal and reflective, from Nashwa Gowanlock on how her mother and the Egyptian movie icon Magda al-Sabahy made her a feminist, to cinema critic Joseph Fahim on how the pandemic gave him pause for thought about the future and what direction he film industry should take. But for me, the strongest article was also the most in-depth: Azad Essa on the global television phenomenon that is Ertugrul.\\n\\nThe piece is wide-ranging but has a very strong focus that cannot but intrigue the reader: how a minor 13th-century warlord from Turkish history has become a cult figure for millions around the globe. You cant help but read it, whether you\\'re interested in Islam or the TV industry or you\\'re simply an Ertugrul geek, like Azad.\\n\\nThrough the article, Azad traces the intrinsic spiritual and emotional appeal of the show and its resonance, critiquing and highlighting influences including other historical Muslim hero figures, Hollywood Islamophobia and the influence of Islam. One of the main takeaways is how the show rekindled imagination for its Muslim viewers across the globe. It\\'s a weighty read, embellished by striking illustrations from Mohamad Elaasar.\\n\\nIt\\'s a very different piece from the one that Azad first pitched to me more than a year ago. During that time, the core pitch underwent several changes. But that happens with all the best articles – and Azad\\'s analysis of Ertugrul was all the better for that wait.\\n\\nAll photos by Lazhar Mansouri.

Soleimani\\'s killing fundamentally changed the political equation in the Middle East, blurring certainties, and nowhere has this been more apparent than in the place of his death, Iraq.\\n\\nThroughout this year, Suadad has used her powers as a journalist to expose how that assassination has reverberated throughout Iraqi politics. She has done so at considerable cost. In October, an opaque arrest warrant was issued for her on charges of \"defamation\".

These were humans.\\'\"\\n\\nAlthough there are regular news updates about the suffering and misery caused by the US-led war in Iraq, Ali Harb revisited the trauma felt by a father who lost his son at the hands of ruthless American mercenaries.\\n\\nIn 2007, private contractors from the US security firm Blackwater opened fire in Baghdad\\'s Nisour Square, killing 17 Iraqi civilians, including nine- and 11-year-old boys. After years of court proceedings, US prosecutors successfully argued in 2014 that the contractors launched an unprovoked attack, using sniper fire, machine-guns and grenade launchers to indiscriminately fire at civilians.\\n\\nBut earlier this month, US President Donald Trump ordered all four men convicted of the killings to be released, undoing the years-long fight for accountability. In an important part of the coverage of the consequences of US military intervention in the Middle East, Ali Harb spoke with Mohammed Kinani, the father of the nine-year-old who was shot dead in the massacre.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know how this is allowed,\" Kinani said as he struggled for words upon learning of the pardon. \"There must be a way.

I asked her what she was doing and she told me this is how kohl is made.”\\n\\nHeritage is an important part of Palestinian identity that cannot easily abandoned. One part of that is the continued use of kohl by Arab women, which Hussaini wonderfully covers across Gaza.\\n\\nIt\\'s easy enough to buy a cheap kohl pen in the territory, but some like Hadia Qudaih prefer to make their own kohl, a tradition inherited from her mother and now seeks to pass down to her daughters and granddaughters.\\n\\nBut this is a piece that transcends fashion or culture: it also underlines the importance of preserving old customs, despite the constant human struggle for originality and modernity that implies such traditions should be abandoned for the sake of progress.\\n\\nHussaini\\'s piece also symbolises hope: that the Palestinians of Gaza who have been besieged by Israeli forces for 13 years will be able to preserve their identity and devise ways not only to survive but to build a better life.\\n\\nIt is a theme that also has resonance for Hussaini herself: in November she was awarded the Martin Adler Prize by the Rory Peck Trust for her reporting from Gaza.\\n\\nExtract: \"I struggle with my children.

              " 'For my ninth birthday, my aunt bought me a colourful scented diary with a lock and two keys. Being from a large family, I never had much in terms of personal space. But the yellow, blue, and pink pages gave me the opportunity to share my most intimate thoughts.\\n\\nWith time, journalling became a habit. I wrote about my first crush. I wrote a letter to God, praying for my pimples to disappear. I wrote about my excitement when I got my period. I wrote about a fight with my cousin. I wrote about the 1991 Gulf War. I wrote about feeling ashamed. I wrote about feeling afraid.\\n\\nThough I was born in Yemen, my family moved around a number of times when I was young. I had just turned 13 when we moved to the US in 1992.\\n\\nIn high school, I loved writing essays and I even offered to write my cousin’s homework. I dreamed of one day being published like my father, who has published more than 15 books. In my late 20s, I started a blog. I moved back to Yemen, and following the breakout of protests there in 2011, I used it to post testimonies, photographs and commentaries about the unravelling situation, which I witnessed first-hand.\\n\\nBut I never really expressed deep emotions or personal reflection until 2013, aged 33, when a conversation with my grandmother spurred me to finally begin to face my pain (both experienced and inherited), without fear of judgment, through my writing.\\n\\nAt first, the pages were filled with rants, self-pity and guilt. But, with time, I let my imagination take over and watched in awe as the pages gradually transformed into fiction.\\n\\nWriting has not only been cathartic, it also transports me to Yemen every day - or every day that I write. And not to the Yemen we see on TV, but to the Yemen I remember.\\n\\nOne foot in Sanaa\\n\\nIn November 1979, on the night before Eid, \"my head fell\" on the southern wing of my family’s 200-year old home in Sanaa. Masqat al-ra’as, the place where the head falls, is the literal Arabic translation for birthplace. While I have lived in many different cities, Sanaa remains the place where I feel most at home.\\n\\nWe may have lived on Sorrel Avenue, Maryland, but inside our home we were in Al-Sayyad neighbourhood. We had one foot in Sanaa and another in Maryland, from the food and the Yemeni satellite channel blasting all day, to the furniture, including the Yemeni low-cushion seating in the basement. Like many immigrant families, my parents often spoke about “home” as the one in Yemen, imagining an inevitable return.\\n\\nPolitics remained a pivotal part of our home life. The painting of my paternal grandfather, Jaddu Ali, and his one eye which he lost due to smallpox, hung proudly on our wall, a reminder of his political sacrifice. As a member of the Free Yemeni Movement, he helped produce a Sacred National Charter that envisioned a reformed constitutional imamate. He was imprisoned, then beheaded, following the thwarted revolt of February 1948 and the assassination of Yemen\\'s monarch, Imam Yahya (1904-1948). A photograph of Jaddu Ali’s head still hangs in the Military Museum in Sanaa as an ode to the 1948 revolutionaries.\\n\\nMy teenage father and uncles were subsequently imprisoned for several years, along with leading scholars of the time. We often begged to hear more about their time in prison and craved details of my uncles\\' escape from detention (though my dad couldn’t). We asked them to teach us how to write secret letters with lemon and toothpicks just like they did.\\n\\nI took these stories as my roadmap, my book of life. I promised myself that I would honour their memory through writing. As we grew up, I had one focus in mind: my inevitable return to Yemen.\\n\\nLoss of a dream\\n\\nNearly 20 years later, my dream was finally realised when I moved back to Sanaa in 2010, aged 30, just before the protests were beginning to take hold in the capital. Along with other young activists and opposition members, I proudly chanted “The people want the end of the regime”, and jumped on the opportunity to embody my revolutionary family.\\n\\nMy self-assigned task was to blog the revolution in English, and to document the dead – their name, age, photographs, time and cause of death – and send it to human rights organisations. I gave talks and wrote policy briefs and political op-eds focused on the situation.\\n\\nBut after doing that for a couple of years, I fell into depression. During that time, people I loved had passed away, some kidnapped or imprisoned. I felt grief over the loss of a dream, the loss of home. I felt powerless simply documenting the suffering of people but not being able to affect any kind of change. I took a step back from activism. I felt weak: my family had endured so much more and yet here I was unable to continue after just a few years.\\n\\nI went off the grid for the first time. Retreating from politics meant retreating from my family legacy, my old life, and my friends. If I wasn’t an activist then who was I?\\n\\nThen one day in 2013, in Sanaa, my maternal grandmother Mama Sayyida shared a difficult memory. She told me how she had attempted to abort her fourth child after finding out she was pregnant while my grandfather was still in prison. She didn’t know how she would handle yet another child, and took pills in the early months to try to terminate her pregnancy. It didn’t work, and she gave birth to a baby girl she named Rajaa.\\n\\nOne of the things that struck me about her stories was that they weren\\'t shared with us. It was astonishing how our childhood stories were only based on the action-filled lives of the men in our family. Few stories were about the women, with the exception of my paternal grandmother Fatimah, who was the daughter of a tribal leader. Mama Sayyida’s sacrifices, however, probably seemed unworthy of documentation.\\n\\nI asked if I could interview her about her life and write about it. She agreed on one condition: that I turn it into a script for a Ramadan musalsal. The soap operas that air daily during Ramadan are renowned for their dramatic plotlines, which she was hooked on.\\n\\nI took as the starting point the story of the death of Rajaa, when she was just nine years old. A stray bullet killed her while they were driving from Sanaa to their village of Bani Husheish during the Siege of Sanaa in 1967. Mama Sayyida\\'s grief was compounded by a deep sense of guilt, as she believed that her child’s death was a punishment for her attempted abortion.\\n\\nAs I began writing Mama Sayyida’s story, I changed her name to Taqiyyah, a common Yemeni name meaning \"prudence\". Soon, I noticed the character begin to morph into someone other than my grandmother. At times, the character resembled my other grandmother Fatima, as in one scene I described her carrying an AK-47 on her horse - something Mama Sayyida never did.\\n\\nTaqiyyah was also like me, opinionated and guilt-ridden, though sometimes she was someone I barely knew. Maybe my character had dissociative identity disorder. Maybe she was simply the embodiment of all Yemeni women, past and present. She was both strong and vulnerable. She was from an alternate reality, but also a reality very familiar to me.\\n\\nStepping away from the struggle\\n\\nBy the time the conflict in Yemen had begun to escalate in January 2015, my husband had moved to Tunisia, and I was travelling back and forth between Sanaa and Tunis. On 19 January, the presidential palace in Sanaa was attacked by Houthi rebels. The next day, Aden airport was shut and we feared that Sanaa airport would be next.\\n\\nWithin three hours of the announcement, I was on the next flight out, without a suitcase, heading for Tunis where my husband was based. I had assumed I would be back soon, but then former president Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi resigned. Saudi air strikes began two months later, on 26 March 2015, just a few days after I found out that I was pregnant with my daughter.\\n\\nThat\\'s when guilt reared its head again. Firstly, because I had the privilege of fleeing the country within a matter of hours. Secondly, because I was a pregnant woman, safe and able to visit the doctor for a check-up, while in Yemen, pregnant women were dying because of the lack of equipment at hospitals and electricity and fuel shortages.\\n\\nI began having nightmares about bombings, hovering aircraft, and I was often running. There was so much running. In one exceptionally disturbing dream, I was chopping a body into pieces, then putting the parts in plastic bags.\\n\\nI was constantly worried about my family and friends and could barely eat. Despite its proximity, I hardly set foot on Tunis beach. I stopped watching the news or checking social media when my doctor warned me about the dangers of stress on the foetus.\\n\\n\\n\\nStepping away fr0m the disturbing images and tweets reduced my anxiety, but added to my guilt. Where before I had been engaged in the struggle, now I felt stuck and helpless.\\n\\nOnce again, I turned to the page. In the two hours that I was writing daily, I could live outside the space of war. I “[transcended] the here and now” as Howard Zinn puts it in his collection of essays, Artists In Times Of War.\\n\\nI no longer thought about things I could not control, like pregnant women who died at checkpoints, parents who watched helplessly as their kids turned to skeletons, or siblings who had to reassemble the body parts of their loved ones in order to bury them after they had been bombed.\\n\\nWriting through the pain\\n\\nThe promised series gradually turned into a novel, which I have dedicated to Mama Sayyida. In it, I write about the daily tufrutas - gatherings - which she loved up until her death, where every afternoon Yemeni women take time off to relax. They wear their beaded dresses, perfume their bodies and blowdry their bangs, then they head to the tufruta, which is sometimes a small intimate gathering between friends, but can also be an opportunity to celebrate a recent wedding, graduation or a birth.\\n\\nThere, in the overcrowded rooms filled with perfumed sweat, cigarettes, shisha and incense, the women take their sacred \"me time\".\\n\\nI wrote my own childhood into the stories too. I wrote about my favourite treat, Abu mal’aqah - or \"father of the spoon\" - which came in a small plastic tub split into two, with milk chocolate on the right and white chocolate on the left. Sometimes I used a tiny wooden spoon to scoop the chocolate out, but most of the time my index finger did the trick.\\n\\nI didn’t just write joyful events, but also chapters I found extremely difficult. I wrote about the dead bodies I had documented, some of them forever engraved in my mind:\\n\\nThe room was 10 by 12 feet with no windows. It didn’t smell like anything at all - neither did the body. Probably because he was killed an hour ago. The only sound a buzzing mosquito with a microphone. The slim body of the 14-year old rested on a twin rolling bed in the middle of the room, draped in a white sheet. “Boo!” I imagined him uncovering the sheet suddenly. It would’ve been an awful prank, but one his father could’ve lived with.\\n\\nToday, from our new home in Brussels where we recently moved for work, I still watch the conflict raging in my country, and like poet Suheir Hammad said, “my head unwraps around what appears limitless, man\\'s creative violence.” Yet, what is different now is that I focus on the only thing I can control and that they can’t take away from me, keeping Yemen alive through stories and culture.\\n\\nBut I have also come to feel emotions other than sadness. Even if they were at first the emotions of my characters, with time they also became mine. When I write about women’s parties, Ammo Ali’s cafe in the old city of Sanaa that served the best tea, or my childhood memories of Yemen’s famous biscuits, Abu Walad, I remove myself from the moments of horror.\\n\\nThrough fiction, I could position myself against deep-set grief and reconstruct the events that had taken place. When I returned to my childhood diaries many years later I was shocked at some of the painful memories that my 11-year-old self had written about that I had buried as an adult.\\n\\nEven more surprising was that my younger self had written about it from a distance, as though she was simply a witness in a report, a lesson it took me decades to unlearn.\\n\\nWriting today allows me to actively pay attention to the trauma I had avoided for a very long time. They say writing is rewriting, and every time I re-read my words, I reflect on them, and create new meaning. Fiction gave me the space I needed to not only grieve but to mourn. As Joan Didion wrote in The Year of Magical Thinking: “Grief was passive. Grief happened. Mourning, the act of dealing with grief, required attention.\"\\n\\nFiction allows me space to consider divergent ideas and think in non-linear ways, because the novel appreciates the complexities of human nature. Through character dialogues, I become my own devil’s advocate and question my own beliefs. At one point, I learned to see those who hurt me in a different way, by making them the protagonist. By doing that, I eventually let go of self-pity and shame.\\n\\nMy novel has been through different versions; what began as a story about my grandmother’s personal journey is now an exploration of the long road to healing. I wish I could ask Mama Sayyida more about her stories today, but she has since passed away. Much was left unsaid, though I have tried to imagine as much as I could in my book.\\n\\nAtiaf AlWazir\\'s writing can be found on her website, where she also keeps a blog. Her novel is still in progress and she is also working on a children\\'s book on resilience. She will be giving a TEDxBerkeley talk in California, US, on Saturday 8 February 2020.\\n\\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.',\n",

              " 'Azerbaijan and Armenia are close to striking a meaningful ceasefire deal over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh and its surrounding regions which have been occupied by Armenia since 1992, Turkish sources have told Middle East Eye.\\n\\nThe deal will mandate Armenia to cede a large chunk of territory while placing a Turkish and Russian peacekeeping mission in the area.\\n\\nOn Sunday, Azerbaijan announced it had captured Shusha, Nagorno-Karabakh\\'s second-largest city, a claim Armenia denied.\\n\\nThe sources, speaking to Middle East Eye on condition of anonymity, said that the rapid progress of Azerbaijani forces on the ground had pushed Armenia to consider the Russian mediation plan, which is backed by Turkey, to stop the conflict.\\n\\nAt least 1,000 people, and possibly up to 5,000, have been killed since fighting broke out on 27 September in the enclave, an internationally recognised part of Azerbaijan but populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians.\\n\\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, reached an understanding on the components of a draft deal on Saturday in a phone call, the sources said.\\n\\nThe details were discussed by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, in a subsequent phone conversation.\\n\\nTwo corridors likely to be established\\n\\nAccording to the draft deal, Armenia will immediately withdraw from five out of seven occupied raions (a type of administrative unit of several post-Soviet states) surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh, once both sides agree to the conditions of the truce.\\n\\nUnder the terms of the ceasefire, Yerevan will pull out from the remaining two raions in 15 days. The draft deal does not require Baku to leave its recently captured territories, but would put a halt to Azerbaijan\\'s offensive against Nagorno-Karabakh, which is now partly controlled by Baku.\\n\\nIn a significant move, both sides will possibly agree to the establishment of two corridors.\\n\\nOne road leading from Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh would initially ensure Yerevan\\'s access to the region. Armenia, in return, will allow the creation of a second corridor which would connect the Azerbaijan territory of Nakhcivan to Baku.\\n\\nThe Turkish and Russian peacekeeping forces would then be deployed to uphold the ceasefire.\\n\\n\"The Azerbaijani government doesn\\'t want to rapidly seize [the city of] Khankendi [Stepanakert in Armenian] and cause civilian casualties,\" one of the Turkish sources said.\\n\\n\"This deal stops the possible humanitarian crisis while honouring the legitimate Azerbaijani demands on the territory.\"\\n\\nTurkey as guarantor\\n\\nNagorno-Karabakh broke away from Azerbaijan in the 1990s, prompting a long unresolved conflict that has seen tens of thousands of people killed.\\n\\nThe disputed mountainous area has been held by Armenian forces for nearly three decades, despite four UN Security Council resolutions urging them to withdraw.\\n\\nIsraeli-made cluster bombs used by Azerbaijan in Nagorno-Karabakh, says Amnesty Read More »\\n\\nThree other ceasefire attempts since September have failed, with both sides accusing each other of violating it.

              " \"I am writing this on a dust-covered laptop. The keys are jamming. I have been ruminating over each sentence, unsure as to why I agreed to write this piece.\\n\\n4 August 2020. Two days prior, I had celebrated my 34th birthday. I had been battling debilitating depression and had been isolated for days. My friends insisted that they come see me, and I was finally starting to feel better - dare I say, even a little bit hopeful. The pandemic was not going to stop me. My devalued salary was not going to stop me. I was determined to be happy.\\n\\nI can still see and hear the explosion. It is constantly replaying in my head. I am terrified\\n\\nThat day, 4 August, began like any other day. I woke up, made myself coffee, prepared breakfast (the usual peanut butter and jelly) and even placed some fruit on my tray. I read the news and checked my emails. I even checked my Tinder app and flirted up a storm. Tuesday was looking good.\\n\\nAround noon, I got on a Webex meeting with my colleagues, and we discussed business as usual. I had lunch, tried to nap unsuccessfully, and hopped into the shower. I decided to sloth around a little bit in my bedroom, naturally drying in a blue bathrobe that a friend had left behind. All of this seems so mundane now.\\n\\nAround 6pm, I heard strange, loud sounds. I got up from my bed and made my way to the living room. I opened a window and popped my head out. I was intrigued and scared. Were we being bombed? What fresh hell was this?\\n\\nThe blast blew Melissa Ajamian’s window out of the wall (Melissa Ajamian/MEE)\\n\\nAll of a sudden, there was a blinding light; an earsplitting sound; a strong, circular, concentrated, broiling blast of air. It slapped me across the face and blew me backwards. I don’t know which of my senses reacted first.\\n\\nAround me, my living room exploded all at once. A window in its entirety, glass and all, slammed against the wall, shattered into a thousand pieces, and came to rest on my couch. It took my cheap IKEA lamp down with it. The curtain tore off and flew across the room; the TV unplugged and fell face down. Both balcony doors blew open, like a scene from The Exorcist.\\n\\nShards of glass, thousands of little pieces, embedded themselves in the wall behind me, in the floor and in the furniture. I am not sure when I started running towards the front door. I am not sure whether I screamed; everyone tells me that I must have. I must have.\\n\\nYellow, orange and red\\n\\nBarefoot, I ran over the glass with no regard for my own skin. I ran to my front door, which was blasted open. I hysterically pushed it closed. I ran to my bedroom, stood, looked around. I was bewildered. What does one wear in a situation like this?\\n\\nI ran my fingers and my hands over my body and my face. I was not injured. Dear God, I was not injured. I ran down to my neighbours’ apartment, screaming. What happened? My elderly neighbour, a witness to Lebanon’s many wars and civil strife, was shrieking in pure hysteria. Her daughter, carrying a baby, was crying unrestrainedly. I had not cried yet.\\n\\nBeirut blast: The final explosion of an evil state Read More »\\n\\nI ran back up to my apartment to find my cat. He was hiding in the corner of my open closet, under all my shirts, like a child on time-out. I ran down again.\\n\\nOn the street, everything was yellow, orange and red. The air was thick with ammonium nitrate, a fact of which I was blissfully unaware. Screaming. All I heard was screaming. It was like a scene out of any movie about the Vietnam War. Everyone looked like Phan Thi Kim Phuc, the Napalm Girl. They were screaming, walking or running towards me.\\n\\nI was dazed. Turning in circles, I looked towards Gemmayze; all I saw was a large, ominous cloud. A black Jeep with blown-out windows parked by me. Inside was a woman with cuts on her face and blood down her arms. We looked at each other intimately, like we had known each other for years. Two strangers in the midst of a pandemic, we held hands and started sobbing uncontrollably. It was the first time I cried.\\n\\nCovered in dust\\n\\nWhen I finally checked my phone, hundreds of messages and calls were pouring through. Mel. Mel. Mel. Where are you? Are you okay? Friends, family, students, acquaintances, colleagues. I am okay. I am okay. I am okay. I convulsively gasped voice notes to everyone. I love you. I am okay.\\n\\n'It was like a scene out of any movie about the Vietnam War. Everyone looked like Phan Thi Kim Phuc, the Napalm Girl' (Illustration by Mohamad Elaasar)\\n\\nA friend rushed to me on his motorbike. We climbed the stairs back up to my apartment. I packed the bare minimum: my wallet, phone charger and some underwear in a big black garbage bag, and I headed to my parents’ home. I don’t remember getting there.\\n\\nI felt dead inside, exhausted, shell-shocked, traumatised - guilty that I survived only with material damage\\n\\nI watched the news with my mom and dad. I had no idea of the extent of the damage to Beirut - the human cost incurred. I climbed into my childhood bed, sweaty, smelly and covered in dust. I hid under the covers. My head hurt, and my heart hurt even more. I laid wide awake, eyes darting back and forth in the darkness.\\n\\nThe next day, I realised this nightmare had actually happened. I felt dead inside, exhausted, shell-shocked, traumatised - guilty that I survived only with material damage. I couldn’t eat or sleep, and hadn’t showered or even brushed my teeth. I couldn’t imagine engaging in such mundane activities.\\n\\nSleepless nights\\n\\nToday, my heart is breaking inside my ribcage. I can still see and hear the explosion. It is constantly replaying in my head. I am terrified. I don’t feel resilient. I can’t organise my thoughts. I feel so guilty, torn between wanting to help my neighbours or pick up the pieces of my broken home.\\n\\nI have no time to mourn. We have no time to mourn. My cat has not budged in days; his food, water and litter box remain untouched. I want to sleep, but all I can hear is shattered glass, grazing against my brain. My fellow citizens are already cleaning up, doing the job that the criminal government is supposed to do.\\n\\nWe have no time to mourn. I feel so much love for them.

              " \"Survivors of the Christchurch terror attack talk to MEE about the memories of the event that ripped their small community open\\n\\nSheikh Hasan Rubel wakes up in the morning feeling like himself again. The sun shines through the large window pane in his living room. His two-year-old daughter hovers in and out, playing with toys that are sprawled across the floor, bathed in the late summer glow.\\n\\nIt’s not until the afternoon that the pain returns.\\n\\n“As the day progresses, and at night time is when I have most of my pain,” he said.\\n\\n“And some days it’s really hard to move my legs because it feels like I’m in so much pain, I don’t want to move.”\\n\\nIn a few days time, Rubel would be returning to the operating room for surgery on his pelvis. A wide crack right down the middle was causing him excruciating pain, leaving him unable to walk for long distances, and always with the aid of a crutch by his side.\\n\\nHe’d spent eight weeks in and out of surgery last year, after being shot three times. Once in the pelvis. Once in the foot. And once in his lower intestines. His foot was mostly healed, but bullet fragments still lodged around his spine would take much longer.\\n\\nThe 35-year-old operations manager moved to New Zealand with his wife five years ago from Bangladesh, settling in Christchurch where he completed his masters and then found work. He was the sole-breadwinner of the family, but is now confined to his home, unable to work.\\n\\nWithout much of a distraction, he was forced to sit at home, alone with the memories of the day that altered the course of his life.\\n\\nOn 15 March last year, Rubel had taken an hour’s break from work to attend the Friday sermon at his local Al Noor Mosque. He arrived early and sat in the second row cross legged, listening to the imam.\\n\\nHalfway through the sermon, he suddenly heard what sounded like fireworks coming from outside the mosque. Then it started getting louder, and closer. He saw flashes of light reflecting off the back wall of the mosque before him, blinking on and off. Then people started running.\\n\\n“I saw people start running, so I tried to run. At that point I got shot [in my foot] from a long distance. That broke a couple of toes.”\\n\\nHe flung himself onto the far wall, before being crushed by the weight of others.\\n\\n“There were many people, and I was on top of them. Some people are on top of me. That time I got shot another two times.”\\n\\nSheikh Hasan Rubel was shot three times during the Christchurch mosque attacks in 2019 (MEE/Mohamed Hassan)\\n\\nRubel’s eyes drift off in to the distance as the scenes replay themselves in his head. He often tried to shut them out, but they were never far away.\\n\\n“Sometimes I try to close my eyes and try to imagine that it’s not real, but I have seen so many things. Those memories hurt me sometimes. Make me depressed. Make me scared of so many things.”\\n\\nIn the few times where he and his wife have left the house, sometimes to run errands or to the hospital for checkups, he was always on edge. If he heard a noise, it startled him. If he saw a car driving too quickly, he became certain there would be a crash.\\n\\nAlmost a year on from the attack, he felt like his life was stuck.\\n\\n“In the past, I always thought: ‘Oh, I have to achieve this thing, I need to do this’, but nowadays I feel like: ‘What’s the point of life?’”\\n\\n“A single incident can happen again that will destroy my life, change my life.”\\n\\nNew Zealand has ‘fundamentally changed’\\n\\nFifty one worshipers were killed on 15 March, between Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre just a 10 minute drive away. More than 40 were seriously injured.\\n\\nA lone gunman armed with assault rifles and shotguns, dressed in camouflage gear, drove between both mosques during the Friday prayer, and opened fire indiscriminately on the people inside. He strapped a wearable camera to his helmet, and streamed the killings live on social media, where it was watched initially by 400 people live, then shared widely across the internet.\\n\\nOn one of his rifles, he painted the names of far-right shooters who had also targeted minority groups in other countries. A manifesto posted to the 8chan forum hours earlier outlined a desire to strike at the heart of a tiny Muslim community on the edge of the world, and send a message to the rest of it.\\n\\nLater in the day, a 28-year-old Australian man, Brenton Tarrant, was arrested and charged with 51 counts of murder, and 40 counts of attempted murder. He pleaded not guilty to all charges, and will commence his trial in June.\\n\\nIt was the worst act of violence the country had witnessed since it’s colonial land wars, and one of the most devastating mass shootings in world history.\\n\\n'A single incident can happen again that will destroy my life, change my life' -Sheikh Hasan Rubel, Christchurch survivor\\n\\nPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who garnered international praise for her response to the attack, attended a joint-prayer on Friday held between both affected mosques, to mark the anniversary.\\n\\n“A year on, I believe New Zealand and its people have fundamentally changed. I can’t see how you could have an event like this and not,” Ardern said at the service.\\n\\n“But the challenge for us will be ensuring that in our everyday actions - and in every opportunity where we see bullying, harassment, racism, discrimination - calling it out as a nation.”\\n\\nA new lease on life\\n\\nHazem Abdul Kareem Mohammed is marking his first birthday today.\\n\\nThe soil scientist, and father of six, said he had faced his death at Al Noor Mosque one year ago, and had been born again.\\n\\nHe was sitting on a chair at the back of the congregation when the shooting began.\\n\\n“I couldn’t get out because there were about twenty people in front of me. Twenty people on the other side,” Mohammed said.\\n\\n“So what I did with myself is I dived, and I bent my legs, and I dived on to my tummy, and I pretended I was a dead soldier.”\\n\\nMohammed held his breath and kept his head to the floor as the shooter paced around the mosque, opening fire at anyone who moved.\\n\\nOne of the bullets hit his shoulder, missing his head by a single inch.\\n\\n“But I didn't move either. If there was any pain, I just bear it.”\\n\\nInstead, he continued to hold his breath, and began plotting how he would escape.\\n\\n“I became a director of a short film in my head. I made a movie about how I would get out of this situation. Is Allah going to help me? Did my wife know I’d been trapped?”\\n\\nAfter a few minutes, when he could no longer hear footsteps, Mohammed stood up slowly and walked down the long corridor leading to the front door of the mosque. He tried not to look down at the bodies of those who’d been killed.\\n\\nIn a daze and covered in his blood, he walked down the street, trying to hail passing cars by. Eventually a friend found him, and they carried an injured woman into the back of the car, before driving to the nearby Christchurch hospital.\\n\\nWhen the final death toll had been confirmed, Mohammed realised he knew most of the victims.\\n\\n“Because I’ve been here for a long time in Christchurch, from these 51 [people] I know personally 45 of them. I visit their families, you know, I know them,” he said.\\n\\n“So I feel sad for these people who lost them. Their husbands or their wives.”\\n\\nHazem Mohammed was sitting at the back of the mosque when the shooting began (MEE/ Mohamed Hasan)\\n\\nThe Iraqi-born man moved to New Zealand in the 1970s with his wife, and lived in Christchurch for over 40 years. He helped build the small Muslim community from fruition.\\n\\nWhen he attended prayers at Al Noor Mosque now, he could see the spaces of who was missing.\\n\\n“These people had done nothing wrong. They just went to the mosque to practice their own religion.”\\n\\nHe spent most of his time at home now, with his family. In his garage, he analysed soil samples from the area and divided them into small samples in clear plastic bags, before sending them abroad for testing.\\n\\nOn some days, when his shoulder hurt too much, he asked his children to help. The doctors told him the pain may never go away.\\n\\n“There are about more than a hundred fragments of the bullets still inside my shoulder.

Let us live in peace and harmony.”\\n\\nLost in the red tape\\n\\nMillions of dollars worth of donations flooded into the community in the days and weeks following the attack, from within the country and abroad.\\n\\nThe government set up an independent fund, The Christchurch Foundation, to speak with victims and distribute more than $12m in donations. After months of consultation, $7m was divided up between the families of the bereaved and survivors, with another $1.6m put aside to set up education funds for their children.\\n\\n'It doesn’t matter what religion you practice, that’s your choice, that’s your freedom. We are Muslims, but we respect other religions. Let us live in peace and harmony' -Hazim Mohammed, Christchurch survivor\\n\\nRaf Manji, an advisor working with the foundation, held more than 160 meetings with members of the community to figure out how to best distribute the money, and to hear their grievances.\\n\\n“We focused very much on the victims. So definitely the bereaved, the bullet-injured, as we called them, and then special funds for children and widows.”\\n\\nHe said there were previously issues with how the government had distributed financial and housing assistance to the victims and their families, and the extraordinary circumstances at hand were often held captive by bureaucracy.\\n\\n“If you think about the community, there are a lot of temporary migrants here; international students, refugees. So everyone’s immigration status was quite uncertain or quite temporary. Now, to access government services, which everyone needed, you needed to be a resident.”\\n\\nMany visa applications were fast tracked by the government, but not all of them. Some families found themselves waiting for months to be able to access vital assistance.\\n\\n“The problem is, Cabinet looked at policy change, and it didn’t go through, so they ended up with a system where people would apply, be rejected, and then have to go through a ministerial appeal process.”\\n\\nManji said he knew at least one family that was still living in emergency housing a year after the attack.\\n\\nIn the aftermath of the attack, the New Zealand government banned the sale and ownership of semi-automatic rifles, offering a buyback option to those who owned the now blacklisted models.\\n\\nIt also launched a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the conduct of state services, from police to the country’s intelligence body - to investigate whether they took threats of far-right activity seriously, and if they could have prevented the attack altogether.\\n\\nThat commission was initially expected to report its findings by 10 December, but is now due on 30 April following an extension requested by those running it. It had so far received more than 1,100 public submissions, including several from Muslim community groups.\",\n",

MBS was very aggressive and gave an ultimatum. He threatened that if there is no agreement, Saudi would start a price war.\\n\\n\"The conversation was very personal. They shouted at each other. Putin refused the ultimatum and the call ended badly,” the Saudi official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\\n\\nBefore getting aggressive with Putin, bin Salman checked in with Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior advisor, who has been described as “the prince\\'s most important defender inside the White House”, according to a second source who also spoke on condition of anonymity.\\n\\n“The call [to Putin] had Trump’s blessing through Kushner.

Reports of the meeting suggested that Saudi Arabia had tried to \"strong arm\" Russia, with one industry analyst commenting: \"We have just witnessed the perils of backing Putin into a corner.\"\\n\\nThe collapsing oil price was initially hailed by Trump, who initially presented it as an opportunity to fill up the US’s own reserves with cheap oil.\\n\\n“We’re going to fill it right up to the top, saving the American taxpayer billions and billions of dollars, helping our oil industry [and furthering] that wonderful goal - which we’ve achieved, which nobody thought was possible - of energy independence,” he said.\\n\\nBut the White House subsequently reversed course after protests from US oil producers, many of whom have invested in more costly shale oil extraction and require significantly higher prices in order to break even.\\n\\nQuiet diplomacy\\n\\nThe Saudi row with Putin over oil production undid months of quiet diplomacy between Moscow and Riyadh.

They decided to buy the system, but they put some conditions. The Saudis wanted part of the Russian system to be manufactured at home. They were serious about the system.

Dmitriev told CNBC in October last year that Russia was not trying to fill the void left by the United States in the Middle East.\\n\\n“Really we are not talking about, you know, the strategic partnerships that Saudi has with the US, and what we are doing is not against the US.

              " 'There are a lot of unprecedented things happening, but not all of them are shocking. For example, it probably shouldn’t surprise you that, once they got their hands on real power, the same lunatics who don’t believe in human biology immediately made a serious mess of our economy. It took them less than six months to do it. First, they acted like the U.S. dollar had no value. They spent money like they’d just printed it for the occasion, which, needless to say, they had. Predictably, we wound up with frightening levels of inflation, which for the record they still deny exists. But inflation does exist, as you well know if you live here. Corn prices, to name just one example of a staple commodity that’s now out of control, have risen by 50 percent just since January. But that wasn’t bad enough. The lunatics decided to make it worse. They paid millions of Americans more than they make at work, to stay home and do nothing. To justify doing this, they used the word \"COVID\" quite a bit, but it had nothing to do with the pandemic. They just wanted to break the system. And so they did. And the rest of us immediately wound up with a bewildering combination of rising unemployment in the middle of a severe labor shortage. So, at the very same time, we found ourselves with too many workers, and also too few workers. That doesn’t even make sense, but thanks to their policies, that’s now exactly what we have. And then, finally, in case 2021 didn’t remind you enough of a grimmer version of the 1970s, we now have serious gas shortages, in a country that just recently was energy independent. All along the east coast of the country today, people couldn\\'t fill up their cars. The footage looks like Venezuela.\\n\\nNBC NEWS: Gas shortages now reported in at least six states and expected to grow. They stretching down the highways as customers wait at the pumps. The Governor of North Carolina has declared a state of emergency. This station there ran out of fuel.\\n\\nABC NEWS: …as pumps run dry and officials urge drivers not to panic buy.\\n\\nGAS STATION WORKERS: We are completely out of diesel and gas.\\n\\nABC NEWS: But already long lines and low fuel gauges.\\n\\nCBS NEWS: The shutdown of the pipelines is already putting airports in Baltimore, Charlotte and others on the east coast at risk of low supply.\\n\\nAn emergency? No. If they ran out of weed that would be an emergency. Don’t worry, says the New York Times. None of this is real, it’s a conspiracy theory. Your eyes are lying to you. You’re hysterical.\\n\\nNEW YORK TIMES PANNED FOR CLAIMING PIPELINE CYBERATTACK CAUSED NO HIKE IN GAS PRICES AFTER LONG REFUELING LINES\\n\\nIn a piece today, the New York Times reported that, quote, \"Since the pipeline shutdown, there have been no long lines at gasoline stations.\" Then, apparently, someone in the New York Times newsroom found a working television and the paper deleted that line from the article a few hours later, without acknowledging it had included the line in the first place.\\n\\nBut for their readers on social media, who presumably will believe absolutely anything, the Times didn’t even bother to change the lie. That tweet is still up.\\n\\n\"Since the shutdown, there have been no long lines or major price hikes at gasoline stations.\" Right. None at all.\\n\\nExcept in the state of Georgia, where, as of 3:00 PM this afternoon, almost six percent of all gas stations had no gas. in Virginia, that number was almost eight percent of all gas stations.\\n\\nIn North Carolina, it was eight and a half percent. In metro Atlanta, the biggest city in the south, more than a fifth of all gas stations had no gasoline to sell. That’s an energy crisis.\\n\\nWhy is it happening? The official explanation is that some mysterious gang of cybercriminals hacked the software at a major American fuel supplier called Colonial Pipeline.\\n\\nColonial Pipeline handles more than two million barrels a day, that’s roughly half the East Coast\\'s supply of diesel, gasoline, and jet fuel. That’s not a small problem in a country — like every country on earth — that still relies almost entirely on fossil fuels to survive. But don’t worry, says our new energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, formerly the incompetent governor of Michigan.\\n\\nLARRY KUDLOW: CYBER HACKING OF THE COLONIAL PIPELINE AND \\'HAMAS SHOOTING WAR ON ISRAEL\\' ARE LINKED\\n\\n\"It’s not that we have a gasoline shortage. It’s that we have this supply crunch.\" Oh. It’s a supply crunch. And that’s very different from a shortage, at least in some theoretical way that’s apparently important to Jennifer Granholm.\\n\\nSo what is the White House doing to do about this \"supply crunch\" that is not a shortage? Well, here\\'s the answer from Anne Neuberger, the confirmed non-genius who serves as the deputy national security advisor for cyber and emerging technologies:\\n\\nANNE NEUBERGER, DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR FOR CYBER AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES: So first we recognize that victims of cyberattacks often face a very difficult situation. They have to just balance off in the cost-benefit when they have no choice with regard to paying a ransom. Colonial is a private company and we’ll defer information regarding their decision on paying a ransom to them.\\n\\nREPORTER: Did the administration offer any advice on whether or not to pay a ransom?\\n\\nANNE NEUBERGER: Typically, that is a private sector decision and the administration has not offered further advice at this time. Given the rise in ransomware, that is one area we’re definitely looking at now to say what should be the government’s approach to ransomware actors and to ransoms overall.\\n\\nTUCKER CARLSON: BIDEN\\'S ECONOMY WILL MEAN NO ELECTRICITY OR SMALL BUSINESSES, BUT AMAZON MAY PAY YOU MORE\\n\\nThat’s the person protecting you from the cybercriminals. Colonial Pipeline, Anne Neuberger would like to remind you, is a, \"private company.\" As a matter of principle, the White House doesn’t get involved in the affairs of private companies, unless of course, its employees were to use the wrong pronouns in a sentence, in which case the FBI would arrive with a swat team and make televised arrests. But in cases where the mere fuel supply of the entire Eastern Seaboard is at stake, Anne Neuberger and her friends at the White House strongly prefer a hands-off approach. They’re situationally libertarian that way.\\n\\nWhat is this about? Well, you know. On some level — let’s be honest about it — the White House approves of this disaster.\\n\\nYes, some gas stations are closed tonight. But soon enough, the lunatics plan to close them all — every gas station in the entire United States, shuttered forever, to make way for some new, as-yet-undefined means of transportation that will magically replace the gasoline engines we’ve used for more than 100 years. This is a green revolution. So who cares about some old pipeline?\\n\\nRemember that on his first day in office, Joe Biden shut down a pipeline, that’s the first thing he did. It was the massive Keystone XL. Biden didn\\'t wait for mysterious hackers to shut it down. He shut it down himself. And more than 11,000 people lost their jobs. And, by the way, gas prices went up. In case you haven’t noticed, gas prices have never gone down.\\n\\nIn the state of California, the average price of a gallon of gas is over $4.00. A year ago it was $2.70.\\n\\nIn Illinois, gas is $3.20 a gallon. Last year it was $2.10. It’s not just two big, liberal states. It’s the entire country.\\n\\nIn Texas, gas prices are averaging $2.70 a gallon. Last year, it was $1.50.\\n\\nIn Maine, the average price of gas is almost $3.00. A year ago, it was under $2.00. And so on.\\n\\nNationally, Americans are paying about $45 billion dollars more for gas overall than they were last year.\\n\\nWhy? This is the result of policy decisions made by the new administration. This is the Green New Deal. We’ve got it already. And if you love gas shortages and electricity blackouts and $80 plywood, this is the program for you.\\n\\nENERGY SECRETARY GRANHOLM ASSERTS THAT GAS PRICES MAY HAVE GONE UP \\'BECAUSE OF THE VIRUS\\'\\n\\nTomorrow, the administration\\'s Bureau of Labor Statistics will release new \"official numbers\" on inflation in America. A key part of that statistic is the Consumer Price Index, which measures the prices of a carefully curated selection of goods and services. If tomorrow’s Consumer Price Index number is flat, people on TV will tell you it\\'s proof that inflation isn\\'t real. Should you believe them? Well, before you take their word, take note of what is not included in the official consumer price index. Lumber, for example. Because no one in America buys building materials. So you should ignore this:\\n\\nREPORTER: In a recent study by Fortune.com, the average price of lumber is now 280% higher than what it was pre-pandemic – which is causing the cost of construction to also increase by 30-40%. In a statement from the Division President of Homes by Towne Jenn Pemstein, he says for a typical 1,500 square foot home, just the rough lumber used for framing has increased from $14,000 per home to $29,000.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nTwo hundred and eighty percent. Wow, Marge, that’s a lot. What’s going on here?\\n\\nTypically, in the material world, where the laws of nature apply when the price of something jumps that quickly and that high, you’ve got a supply problem. Because it’s supply and demand. There isn’t enough of that thing to go around. Does that apply to lumber? Are there fewer spruce trees out there than there were a year ago? Are those trees growing more slowly than they once did? Have we seen a 280% in new houses being built? The answers: no, no and no. The answer, as you may have guessed, is that bad federal policies are distorting the price of everything in this country, from two by fours, to diesel fuel to corn dogs. None of this is an accident. Just as it wasn’t an accident when the power went out in Texas over the winter. It wasn’t a cold snap that did it, it was a federal policy that encouraged the state to rely on windmills that don’t actually work. So, it’s not a natural cycle. Somebody did this to us on purpose.\\n\\nThis article is adapted from Tucker Carlson\\'s opening commentary on the May 11, 2021, edition of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\"',\n",

Amazon had a gangbusters year, they did so well. Last spring when you could not buy anything at your local store, could not go shopping for clothes, for example. Lots of people had their clothing delivered on Amazon. I think priority one has to be shopping locally, in your own neighborhood, in your own town.\\n\\nI was an Amazon addict. I would shop everything on Amazon, I had boxes arriving at my door every single day. I really had to ask myself did I want to continue on with a company that was making society in a way I did not want to be. Them pulling several conservative books was sort of the last straw for me. I realized we are really going to have an issue going forward if Amazon gets to decide what we read, and of course, other things they do also really noxious to me. I made the decision to stop shopping them. Look, at 11:00 at night if my kids tell me they need glue for school and Amazon will get it to be the next day, I’ll buy it. But I decreased my spending on Amazon drastically, and I urge other people to do the same.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO WATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW',\n",

(Photo: Reuters)\\n\\nThe US is looking at joint production of Johnson and Johnson\\'s Covid-19 vaccine in India and ways to help manufacturers like the Serum Institute of India (SII) to boost production, Daniel B Smith, the Charge D\\'Affaires of the US embassy, said on Tuesday.\\n\\nSmith also said that the efficacy of AstraZeneca\\'s Covid-19 vaccine manufactured at a production facility in Baltimore is not yet clear and the Food and Drug Administration has not yet certified that the doses are available for anyone\\'s use or for export.\\n\\nLast month, the White House said that the US plans to share 60 million doses of AstraZeneca\\'s vaccine globally as soon as they become available, and India expected a significant chunk of the total stockpile.\\n\\nAt a media briefing, Smith said the US was concerned over the current course of the pandemic in India, not simply because of the humanitarian catastrophe but also due to the fact that it has global implications, noting that the Biden administration was standing with New Delhi to help deal with the crisis.\\n\\n\"I know that there are a number of doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine (with the US). They were manufactured in the US. They were manufactured at a plant outside of Baltimore but there were problems with this plant. So far the Food and Drug Administration of the US has not certified that these vaccines are available for anyone\\'s use; for export or not,\" he said.\\n\\n\"So I cannot say when that will happen or what will be done exactly as we go forward on this,\" Smith said when asked whether the US was going to make available the AstraZeneca vaccine doses to India on an urgent basis.\\n\\nHe said the US was eager to supply the vaccine doses to the world but not before it is sure that they are safe and effective.\\n\\nSmith, who recently served as acting Secretary of State and acting Deputy Secretary of State, was appointed as Charge d\\'Affaires primarily to oversee and coordinate the US\\' assistance to India in dealing with the pandemic.\\n\\nTo a question on joint production of coronavirus vaccines, Smith said the setting up of joint productions takes time and that the US was looking at how it can invest in boosting production.\\n\\n\"Our development finance cooperation is looking at how we can invest so that we can help produce the Johnson and Johnson\\'s vaccine here in India. And I know that there are some private-sector production talks that are underway from pharmaceutical companies to pharmaceutical companies,\" he said.\\n\\n\"We are determined to do all we can as a government to encourage licensing and encourage more production and if there is a need for capital, we will look at what we can provide and whether we can provide assistance,\" he said.\\n\\nSmith said India\\'s role in the production of Covid-19 vaccines at the global stage is critical.\\n\\n\"I think we are watching carefully the production levels at the SII and elsewhere. We\\'ve been in close touch with the SII to try to determine what raw materials we could provide, and assistance that we can provide to help boost production,\" he said.\\n\\nThe US has been in touch with multiple vaccine manufacturers in the country.\\n\\n\"We want to do all we can to boost that production because I have heard from some of my colleagues in neighbouring countries, from the government of Bhutan, about their concern that India, of course, is having to divert a lot of its existing production to its own domestic needs, which is absolutely understandable,\" he said.\\n\\n\"But in the same token, it means a lot of these countries are at risk that they will not get a second round of this vaccination. So we are looking to partner with other countries, we are looking at what we can do both to boost the production here in India but also to make up for whatever shortfall exists as a result of India\\'s own dire need for these vaccines,\" he added.\\n\\nAs India reeled from a devastating second wave of coronavirus infections, the US rapidly deployed six planeloads of life-saving supplies in support of the country\\'s fight against the pandemic.\\n\\nThe US government\\'s assistance to India is estimated at $100 million.\\n\\nSmith said there was a need to work closely to address issues relating to the supply chain.\\n\\n\"A lot of the companies that manufacture key components and raw materials are located in the US, but many are not. So we are going to have to work together as a global community to address some of these supply chain issues and challenges that we face as we go forward,\" he said.\\n\\n\"We are concerned obviously with the current course of the pandemic in India, not simply because of the humanitarian catastrophe but the fact that it has global implications,\" the US Charge D\\'Affaires said.',\n",
              " 'The entrance to the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir is seen in Robbinsville Township, N.J., May 11. (Photo:AP)\\n\\nFBI agents were at a large Hindu temple in New Jersey on Tuesday as a new lawsuit claimed it was built by workers from marginalized communities in India who were lured to the US and forced to work long hours for just a few dollars per day.\\n\\nThe lawsuit accuses the leaders of the Hindu organization known as Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha, or BAPS, of human trafficking and wage law violations.\\n\\nAn FBI spokesperson confirmed that agents were at the temple on “court-authorised law enforcement activity,” but wouldn’t elaborate. One of the attorneys who filed the suit said some workers had been removed from the site Tuesday.\\n\\nThe lawsuit says more than 200 workers — many or all of whom don’t speak English — were coerced into signing employment agreements in India. They traveled to New Jersey under R-1 visas, which are meant for “those who minister, or work in religious vocations or occupations,” according to the lawsuit.\\n\\nWhen they arrived, the lawsuit says, their passports were taken away and they were forced to work at the temple from 6:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. with few days off, for about $450 per month a rate that the suit said came out to around $1.20 per hour. Of that, the workers allegedly only received $50 in cash per month, with the rest deposited into their accounts in India.\\n\\nAccording to the lawsuit, the exploited workers were Dalits — members of the lowest step of South Asia’s caste hierarchy.\\n\\nAn attorney representing several of the workers, Daniel Werner, called it “shocking that this happens in our backyard.”\\n\\n“It is even more disturbing that it has gone on for years in New Jersey behind the temple’s walls,” Werner, of Decatur, Georgia, said Tuesday outside the gates of the complex. He said some workers were on the site for a year, two years or even longer, and were not allowed to leave unless accompanied by somebody from BAPS.”\\n\\nBAPS CEO Kanu Patel, who is named as a defendant in the lawsuit, told The New York Times, “I respectfully disagree with the wage claim.”\\n\\nA spokesperson for the organization, Matthew Frankel, told The Associated Press that BAPS was first made aware of the accusations early Tuesday morning.\\n\\n“We are taking them very seriously and thoroughly reviewing the issues raised,” he said.\\n\\nThe ornate temple, known as a mandir, is made of Italian and Indian marble, and sits on 162 acres (65 hectares) in Robbinsville, outside Trenton.\\n\\nThe lawsuit said workers lived in a fenced-in compound where their movements were monitored by cameras and guards. They were told that if they left, police would arrest them because they didn’t have their passports, the suit said.\\n\\nThe lawsuit names Patel and several individuals described as having supervised the workers. It seeks unpaid wages and unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.\\n\\nD.B. Sagar, president of the Washington-based International Commission for Dalit Rights, told The Associated Press that Dalits are an easy target for exploitation because they’re the poorest people in India.\\n\\n“They need something to survive, to protect their family,” Sagar — a Dalit himself — said, adding that if the allegations in the lawsuit are true, they amount to “modern-day slavery.”\\n\\nBAPS is a global sect of Hinduism founded in the early 20th century and aims to “preserve Indian culture and the Hindu ideals of faith, unity, and selfless service,” according to its website. The organization says it has built more than 1,100 mandirs — often large complexes that essentially function as community centers.\\n\\nBAPS is known for community service and philanthropy, taking an active role in the diaspora’s initiative to help India amid the current COVID-19 surge. But it also is linked to contentious issues in India, publicly supporting and funding the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, built on the site of a mosque demolished by Hindu nationalists.\\n\\nIndia’s right-wing prime minister, Narendra Modi, has close ties to the organization and one of its transformative leaders, Pramukh Swami Maharaj, who died in 2016.\\n\\nThe ongoing construction on the mandir in Robbinsville began in 2010, and the site has caught the attention of state and federal authorities in recent years.\\n\\nLast month, the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development issued a stop-work order against a Newark-based construction company whose projects included the BAPS temple in Robbinsville.\\n\\nAn investigation found the company, Cunha Construction, was paying workers in cash off the books and didn’t have workers’ compensation insurance, according to a release. A phone listed for the company rang unanswered Tuesday. It’s not named in the lawsuit.\\n\\nIn 2017, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigated after a Pennsylvania teenager was killed in a fall while volunteering at the site.\\n\\nAccording to the website for the Robbinsville mandir, its construction “is the epitome of volunteerism.”\\n\\n“Volunteers of all ages have devoted their time and resources from the beginning: assisting in the construction work, cleaning up around the site, preparing food for all the artisans on a daily basis and helping with other tasks,” the website says. “A total of 4.7 million man hours were required by craftsman and volunteers to complete the Mandir.”\\n\\nAlso Read | US declares state of emergency as cyber attack shuts down major pipeline',\n",

(Photo:AP)\\n\\nA man who fatally shot six people at a Colorado birthday party before killing himself was upset after not being invited to the weekend gathering thrown by his girlfriend’s family, police said Tuesday, calling the shooting an act of domestic violence.\\n\\nThe shooter, 28-year-old Teodoro Macias, had been in a relationship with one of the victims, 28-year-old Sandra Ibarra, for about a year and had a history of controlling and jealous behavior, Colorado Springs police Lt. Joe Frabbiele said at a news conference. Police said there were no reported incidents of domestic violence during the relationship and that the shooter didn’t have a criminal history. No protective orders were in place.\\n\\n“At the core of this horrific act is domestic violence,” Police Chief Vince Niski said, adding that the gunman had “displayed power and control issues” in the relationship. About a week before the shooting, there was another family gathering where there “was some sort of conflict” between the family and Macias, Niski said.\\n\\nAlso See: One dead, multiple wounded in stabbing at Vancouver-area library, suspect in custody\\n\\nThe other victims of the shooting early Sunday were Ibarra’s extended family. They were identified as Melvin Perez, 30; Mayra Ibarra de Perez, 33; Joana Cruz, 52; Jose Gutierrez, 21; and Jose Ibarra, 26.\\n\\nInvestigators don’t know yet how the shooter got the weapon, which Frabbiele described as a Smith & Wesson handgun. He said it was originally purchased by someone else in 2014 at a local gun store but was not reported stolen. The gunman had two 15-round magazines, one of which was empty, and police recovered 17 spent shells at the scene.\\n\\nThe shooting occurred at a home in the Canterbury Mobile Home Park on the east side of Colorado’s second-largest city. Three children at the party, ages 2, 5 and 11, were not hurt.\\n\\nAlso See: Police officer among 10 killed in Colorado supermarket shooting; suspect arrested\\n\\nTwo families were celebrating the birthdays of family members, and 10 people were inside the home when the gunman arrived “and shot all six victims in quick succession” before turning the gun on himself, Frabbiele said. The children inside were in “close proximity” to the shots fired, he said.\\n\\nPolice received the first of three 911 calls from inside the home. Another was made by an adult who managed to escape.\\n\\nThree teenagers had left the party just before the shooting, Frabbiele said. They returned shortly after to discover what happened. Arriving officers found Jose Gutierrez gravely wounded inside; he told the officers the suspect was in the home, Frabbiele said. Gutierrez died later at a hospital.\\n\\n“One of the smaller children and some of the teenagers lost both parents,” Frabbiele said.\\n\\nPolice say the families of the victims had requested privacy.\\n\\n“In Colorado, we’ve had domestic terrorism incidents where lots of people were killed, we’ve had random acts like going into a King Soopers or a movie theater, but let’s not forget about the lethality of domestic violence,” Colorado Springs Mayor John Suthers said.\\n\\nSuthers was referring to a March 22 attack on a King Soopers supermarket in Boulder, Colorado, that killed 10 people, including a police officer, and a 2012 shooting at a movie theater in the Denver suburb of Aurora that killed 12 and injured 70.\\n\\n“What we have here is a situation where all these people were together and (we) apparently had the anger directed at the adults and his partner. And the tragic consequences are unfathomable. We’ve got children orphaned by this situation,” Suthers said.\\n\\nGladis Bustos, who lives three homes away, had tearfully identified the home’s owner as Joana on Monday. Bustos called her a warmhearted, hardworking person who always took the time to say hello to her neighbors and brag about her children.\\n\\nColorado Springs police say eight of 15 homicides this year, including Sunday’s victims, were related to domestic violence. Last year, nine of 39 homicides were tied to domestic violence.\\n\\nThe weekend attack follows a series of mass shootings — defined as four or more dead, not including the shooter — to plague the U.S. this year.\\n\\nBefore the Colorado Springs shooting, a database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University showed there had been at least 11 mass shootings since Jan. 1, compared with just two public mass shootings in 2020.\\n\\nAfter the Boulder shooting, Colorado lawmakers introduced a bill to create a state Office of Gun Violence Prevention to educate residents about gun safety and collect data on Colorado gun violence.\\n\\nOther bills advancing through the Democratic-led Legislature would tighten background checks, allow municipalities greater freedom to adopt gun control laws that are stricter than state law, and require a person facing a protection order related to domestic violence to report what firearms they possess.\\n\\nAlso Read | At least 11 killed in school shooting in Russia, several injured\\n\\nAlso Read | Indian-origin man charged with killing, sexually abusing his 65-year-old mother in New York',\n",
              " 'Paints, canvasses and brushes have replaced the dull sight of forlorn roads and anxiety-inducing news reports in Lata Chaudhry’s daily routine. The 84-year-old Bandra resident, who suffers from advanced-stage Alzheimer’s and dementia, spends long hours painting village scenes and figures. Her focus is now fixed on depicting the Warli tribe that lives in the mountains along the Maharashtra-Gujarat border. This activity is the only proverbial silver lining in the day of the octogenarian who was getting adversely impacted by news of disease, suffering and death and the soundless lanes during the lockdown. In a bid to add a dash of hope and colour into her life, her son Paresh brought in a set of canvasses and paints a few months ago and urged Chaudhry to rekindle her long lost love for painting. Her family claims that ever since she picked up her paint brushes, “there has been no looking back”.\\n\\nLike Chaudhry, several people are finding solace in different forms of art that help relieve anxiety. From painting and embroidery to knitting and origami, activities that requires concentration and give the doer a feeling of having created something new, are being used to help soothe frayed nerves. “When you are creating art, you are completely one with yourself. There is a feeling of fulfilment because you are creating something from scratch and to watch your creation come to life is very therapeutic,” says Akshita Gandhi, artist and founder of the Dua Foundation.\\n\\nAs the number of infections and deaths soar dangerously, an increasing number of people are discovering how sketch pens, crayons, pencils and water colours can alleviate anxiety. Even as she anxiously awaited updates from the hospital on the health of her Covid-infected husband and parents, Aisha Dhuru, 38, ordered knitting needles and wool, and “furiously knitted all day”. “It requires total attention and focus and that helped me block negative thoughts which were leading to severe anxiety and sleeplessness,” she says.\\n\\nArt has, for long, been used by alternative healing practitioners to work with patients working through mental health issues. And just as sketching can help people pour their feelings and emotions on paper, colours have the ability to evoke emotions. “If you are going through some kind of physical pain, surround yourself with a lot of green colour. It is believed that you start to heal faster as green symbolises life and nurturing,” says Gandhi. The concept relates to the colours of the energy fields in the body that are believed to play a role on mental and physical health.\\n\\nWith the pandemic raging across the country and people losing both loved ones and livelihoods, anxiety levels are bound to be on the rise, which, if left unchecked, can lead to severe mental ailments. “Breathlessness, sleeplessness, cold sweat, depression or palpitations are all a part of what we are experiencing around us today. That’s where art can step in. Spending even 30 minutes every day on creating something can alleviate stress and help combat anxiety because it distracts you from the negativity and immerses you in a happy feeling,” says Roohi Jain, a counsellor who uses art and music for healing patients.\\n\\nNoting this demand for a creative activity, several brands have launched art kits that provide the necessary tools and activity sheets for people to revisit art classes from their school days. But as Jain explains, art as a healing tool does not need you to create picture-perfect paintings. Scribbling, doodling, sketching or abstract strokes of paint on canvas or paper can still be therapeutic.\\n\\nRead India Today magazine by downloading the latest issue: https://www.indiatoday.com/emag',\n",
              " 'While the Covid pandemic has emerged as the biggest challenge to the Narendra Modi-led BJP government at the Centre, the principal opposition party, the Congress, is looking at this crisis as a catalyst to revive itself. If Congress insiders are to be believed, this crisis has given the party an opportunity to connect with the people and present it as an alternative to Modi and the BJP, at a time when the prime minister’s popularity has taken a hit because of the mishandling of the Covid crisis. Even dissenters within the Congress, who had been warning about the decimation of the “Gandhi family-run” party, are now relenting that the pandemic may give the party another chance of revival without having to do any hard work towards revamping and restructuring the party.\\n\\n“In India, people vote to throw someone out of power. When they are angry, they don’t really see who they are voting for. So, any non-BJP force may get lucky,” says one of the senior Congress leaders in the group of 23 leaders—popularly known as ‘G23’—that had written a letter to party chief Sonia Gandhi last August and sought an organisational overhaul and accountable leadership. In fact, they believe that the current crisis may give Rahul Gandhi another opportunity to return to the helm of Congress affairs in an official capacity, despite the party’s continuing electoral debacles.\\n\\nSince 2014, when Modi first stormed into power, the Congress has witnessed a series of reverses, the latest being the disastrous performance in four of the five assembly elections held recently—in Assam, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Kerala. Even in Tamil Nadu, where the party is a junior ally of the DMK, which dethroned the incumbent AIADMK government, the credit for the party’s success—winning 18 of the 25 seats it contested—went to the DMK’s popularity and performance.\\n\\nTaking note of these serious setbacks, in the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting held on May 10, party president Sonia Gandhi said: “We need to candidly understand why we failed to dislodge the incumbent governments in Kerala and Assam, and why we drew a blank in West Bengal. These will yield uncomfortable lessons, but if we do not face up to the reality, if we do not look the facts in the face, we will not draw the right lessons.” Sonia even announced that a committee will be formed—within 48 hours, as later revealed by party general secretary (organisation) K.C. Venugopal—to examine the reasons behind the losses.\\n\\nThis is a welcome step, but the ‘G23’ leaders believe that Gandhi family loyalists are not ready to learn any lessons and that this is yet another step to deflect attention from the real issues. They claim that until and unless the Congress settles the issue of central leadership, the party cannot revive the state units. While Sonia is the president, Rahul Gandhi, the Lok Sabha MP from Kerala’s Wayanad, remains the de-facto leader and face of the party even though he quit as Congress president two years ago, owning responsibility for the 2019 Lok Sabha election debacle.\\n\\nSince then, several electoral setbacks have led many within the party to question the leadership credentials of Rahul. “Who do you blame for the rout the party faced in Kerala where Rahul led from the front?” asks one of the ‘G23’ leaders who had earlier demanded an election to the post of the Congress president, since Sonia has been functioning as interim president. Responding to their demands, the CWC had asked the party’s Central Election Authority (CEC) to make arrangements to elect the next president. The CEC accordingly submitted a plan, scheduling the election on June 23. However, in the May 10 CWC meeting, all members unanimously agreed to defer the election process considering the current pandemic.\\n\\nThe ‘G23’ leaders, who also argued that this is not the right time to hold an election, however, say that Gandhi family loyalists deliberately proposed a date knowing well that others would not have any option other than rejecting the idea of holding elections in the middle of a raging pandemic. “This has come as a Godsend opportunity as Rahul has not agreed to contest and a dummy candidate has every chance of losing the polls. They have bought time to convince Rahul,” says a ‘G23’ leader.\\n\\nGandhi family loyalists dismiss such allegations, saying that Sonia showed intent by fixing the date for an election. Both Venugopal and Randeep Singh Surjewala, party general secretary and communication in-charge, said that the deferment is not open ended and the election process would be completed in next two or three months. There is though no consensus among Rahul loyalists as to whether he would contest the presidential poll.\\n\\n“Rahul Gandhi must contest the poll to save the party. He has already given the hint that he would. He has already been saying that he would do whatever the party asks him to do,” says a CWC member close to Rahul, adding that Covid has provided him the right momentum to emerge as the alternative to Modi. According to Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, the Congress’s leader in the Lok Sabha, “India has seen how he kept warning about Covid and how Modi kept ignoring it. By ignoring Rahul Gandhi’s warning, Modi has heaped unprecedented suffering on the people of India.”\\n\\nOther family loyalists though believe that Rahul will not contest the poll and should step aside in the interest of the party. Instead, there has been a growing murmur to project Priyanka Gandhi-Vadra as a presidential candidate.

But he has so far been unable to match a pledge made in the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign of handing the health service 350 million pounds ($494 million) a week.\\n\\nHis government will instead try to reduce what it saw as excessive EU bureaucracy by streamlining state aid and procurement rules so it can target funds to ailing businesses more quickly and directly.\\n\\nAlso part of the government\\'s strategy to \"build back better\" from the coronavirus pandemic are education reforms to help adults access life-long learning - seen by ministers as key to reshaping the British workforce.\\n\\nOn climate change, the government reaffirmed its commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, a pledge it hopes will spur other nations to cut their emission targets before a U.N. climate summit in November in Scotland.\\n\\nMuch of Tuesday\\'s \"Queen\\'s Speech\" comprised policies and proposals already flagged, prompting the Labour Party to challenge the government to turn its \"rhetoric into reality\".\\n\\nLabour leader Keir Starmer accused Johnson of running away from a \"decade of neglect\", saying if the prime minister truly wanted to oversee real change, he would have done more to create jobs with a \"game-changing employment bill\".\\n\\nHe and others also criticised the omission of thorny issues such as the provision of adult social care, which successive governments have avoided tackling. The government said it would make reform proposals for the sector in 2021.\\n\\n\"This is the time for a transformative agenda to rebuild Britain\\'s foundation after a decade of neglect and a year of national sacrifice,\" Starmer said.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a chance that has been squandered.\"\\n\\nAlso Read | States with heavy Covid-19 caseloads showing decline, says health ministry\\n\\nAlso Read | Centre issues fresh orders to procure vaccines from Serum, Bharat Biotech',\n",

According to the New York Times -- \"there is not a single documented COVID infection anywhere in the world from casual outdoor interactions, such as walking past someone on a street or eating at a nearby table.\" Yes, you heard that right. The New York fricken Times admits that outdoor COVID transmission is the biggest myth since Trump colluded with Russia.\\n\\nNot a single documented COVID infection anywhere in the world from casual outdoor interactions. Such as dining, strolling, or giving Jesse Waters the finger. Which you should do at every opportunity. And yet, what do you see?\\n\\nPeople outside, masked up, sometimes wearing two, others wearing face shields - as if they\\'re about to clean Shane MacGowan\\'s teeth--He\\'s the singer for the Pogues. This is why I tell ya to floss Kat! She doesn’t listen.\\n\\nSo how did we get here? First: we were lied to. Last month the CDC told us that less than 10 percent of transmissions were from outdoors. Which is true - technically \"point one percent\" is less than 10 percent. And that\\'s likely the real rate of transmission. Point one percent - not ten. That\\'s a hundred-fold difference, I think.\\n\\nBut, of course, the media spread that large number like herpes in a beehive full of slutty bees.

Cuz it\\'s pointless.\\n\\nIt\\'s like wearing a seatbelt to lunch. Or a football helmet to bed. Thank God those days are behind me.\\n\\nSo the CDC lied to us. They made a statement they knew was technically accurate, but intended to deceive. True, a tenth of a percent is literally less than ten percent. This is like saying there are less than 10 thousand black bear attacks a year in the US. It\\'s true, there\\'s roughly one black bear attack a year. I bet it\\'s the same bear and the same guy.

The CDC still says if you\\'re unvaccinated, you should wear masks outdoors, and even the vaccinated should wear them at large events like concerts, sporting events, and \"We Love Greg Gutfeld\" rallies. And they\\'re still having kids wear them at summer camp at all times. Which I’m fine with cuz I hate children but I know it’s wrong.\\n\\nBut apart from Operation Warp Speed, our pandemic response isn\\'t grounded in science. It\\'s grounded in science fiction. I wonder how our angry White male feels about this.\\n\\nTom Shillue as Angry White Male: Masks? No, I don’t wear one.

Yes, people who climb Mount Everest are at risk for COVID - as opposed to the normal way of dying on Mount Everest. Which is being impaled on a pile of frozen poop.\\n\\nBut the normal risk of dying on the mountain is between 0.5 and 1.1 percent. Or to put it another way, it’s somewhat less than one thousand percent. But it\\'s higher than the death rate for a 25-year-old from COVID at any elevation. Something tells me when you\\'re going to Nepal to find the untold story of COVID - you\\'re getting desperate. I\\'m still waiting on the COVID numbers of people who live under the sea.\\n\\nSo why the mask lie so bad? It\\'s another transparent deception that makes the average person skeptical about everything the government tells us about COVID. Even the true stuff. And it creates conflicts between self-righteous a--holes and the nice people they’re mask-shaming.\\n\\nVideo of man shaming maskless woman: I want you to know that your insensitivity is ridiculous.

              " 'Apple’s manufacturing partner Foxconn recently confirmed that at least 10 employees at its Chennai facility tested Covid-19 positive. Since the Taiwanese company claimed it took all safety measures in hospitalising the patients and sanitising the facility, the iPhone manufacturing business kept running. But now, the production capacity of Foxconn’s Chennai facility has dropped by half because over 100 employees have returned positive for Covid-19.\\n\\nA report by Reuters highlights that Foxconn is struggling to keep up with its full iPhone production capacity. With over 100 employees now infected, it has come down to almost half. Foxconn has made arrangements for the employees who have kept the production running. It has created on-site dormitory accommodation for the employees who are doing fine so far. The entry of employees and other staff from the outside is prohibited until late May so that the on-site employees do not become prone to infection. “Only a small part of output is being kept,” the Reuters report citing sources said.\\n\\n“Foxconn places the health and safety of our employees as our highest priority and that is why we have been working closely with local government and public health authorities in India to address the challenges that we and all companies are facing in dealing with the COVID-19 crisis,” Foxconn told Reuters. However, Foxconn has not officially confirmed the reduction in the production of the Apple iPhone at its Chennai plant. Reuters’ report, too, has not mentioned the current manufacturing capacity, other than saying that it has been halved.\\n\\nChennai and the rest of the state of Tamil Nadu is one of the worst-hit states in India by the second wave of Covid-19. The state is reporting close to 30,000 Covid-19 positive patients daily, while the death toll is also around 300, according to the state government’s health bulletin. The Tamil Nadu government announced a full lockdown in the state starting Monday earlier this week. Manufacturing industries have got certain relaxations from the lockdown, which is why Foxconn and other companies have been working.\\n\\nOther than Foxconn, Wistron -- which is another manufacturer of the iPhone -- had to close its facility in Karnataka for three days after five employees tested positive for Covid-19. The facility seems to have opened again but there is no information about the production capacity with which it is running right now.\\n\\nThe dip in production capacity at Foxconn will impact the availability of the iPhone in India and other countries where units are exported. Foxconn and Wistron now manufacture the iPhone 12, iPhone XR, iPhone 11, and the iPhone SE 2020 in India. Apple has not commented on this matter.',\n",

              " 'Google IO is primarily a developer conference, however, it has also been the home to many of the brand\\'s biggest announcements. This year\\'s event is expected to be jam-packed, with plenty of big announcements to be made. Also because the last Google IO was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Not just this, Google CEO Sundar Pichai last month hinted at \"significant product updates and announcements\" at IO 2021.\\n\\nWe have frequently seen leaks around the Pixel 5a, Pixel 6, Pixel Watch, Pixel Buds A, Android 12 and more in recent time. Google may likely go out and release some of these products in the upcoming event.\\n\\nGoogle has also released the complete schedule of the Google IO 2021. This year\\'s event begins on May 18 with a two-hour-long keynote, followed by a developer-focused 45-minute keynote. Google should also talk about the developments in Android 12 in the \"What\\'s new in Android\" keynote.\\n\\nGoogle will hold plenty more keynotes to talk about other developments. So sit back and read this article to find out everything expected at the Google IO 2021.\\n\\nHow to watch Google IO 2021\\n\\nLike mentioned before, this year\\'s conference is taking place online from May 18 to May 20. You can register on the Google IO website to attend this three-day event for free. Google will be streaming this complete event on its official youtube channel. Don\\'t forget to tune in on May 18 at 10:30 PM IST, as this is when the biggest announcements will happen.\\n\\nEverything expected at Google IO 2021\\n\\nAs mentioned before, Google will have a lot to show at the upcoming event including. Google is expected to talk about Android, Google Assistant, Google Duplex, Wear OS, Google lens and hardware products like Pixel 5a, Pixel Buds A and Chromecast. Here are the highlights.\\n\\nAndroid 12\\n\\nAs per the schedule released by Google, Android 12 is heading towards the public beta version. We already know about plenty of upcoming features on Android 12. This new Android version is expected to bring a major UI overhaul and plenty of other functional features. From what we have seen, Android 12 will bring improvements to split-screen, notifications, lock screen, widgets, privacy, and a lot more.\\n\\nPixel 5a\\n\\nPixel 5a renders\\n\\nThe next big announcement expected is about Google\\'s upcoming mid-range device, the Pixel 5a. Plenty of leaks have appeared around this smartphone, some of which hint that Pixel 5a will make way at Google IO 2021. But we suggest you take this information with a pinch of salt as Google made an official statement that the Pixel 5a will be released \"later this year\". This statement came soon after rumours around the cancellation of the upcoming Pixel 5a popped up.\\n\\nRenders suggest that the Pixel 5a will look akin to the Pixel 4a 5G. Also, we know that the smartphone will be powered by Qualcomm\\'s midrange 5G chipset 765G. Google also revealed that the Pixel 5a would only be exclusive to the US and Japan.\\n\\nPixel Buds A\\n\\nPixel Buds A leaked by Google\\n\\nThe next expected product is called the Pixel Buds A. Much like Google\\'s affordable Pixel A smartphone series, this is supposed to be a cheaper alternative to the Pixel Buds. Google already leaked the Pixel Buds A through which we know that it looks akin to the Pixel Buds with similar dimensions. It has also been found out that the Pixel Buds A will be made available in White and Green colour options.\\n\\nGoogle is likely to cut down a few features to reduce the upcoming Pixel Buds A pricing. The last Pixel Buds were announced in the Made by Google event in 2019. However, they were later released in April 2020, which makes us assume that we could hear about the Pixel Buds during the Google IO 2021.\\n\\nWear OS\\n\\nLeaks around the Pixel Watch have been making rounds for quite some time now. So it\\'s likely that the software developers at Google are working to fix the caveats in Wear OS. Recently Google introduced Gboard for Wear OS. Also, we have heard that Google will be pushing third-party developers to support Tiles.\\n\\nBesides this, the Android 11 update for WearOS is due too, so we predict Google will talk about the features and improvements coming to Wear OS in the upcoming event.\\n\\nGoogle Assistant\\n\\nGoogle has been continuously working to bring improvements to its Assistant. In the past 12 months, Google Assistant has seen various updates such as light bar Phone UI, Snapshot feed, better settings, driving mode, Smart home features and more. While Google Assistant has come a long way, there\\'s still room for plenty of improvement in terms of complete voice control.\\n\\nGoogle Lens and Google Duplex\\n\\nSearch results on Google lens\\n\\nGoogle Lens, as well as Google Duplex both, were introduced at Google IO in subsequent years. Google lens feature was made available to consumers in 2017, whereas Google Duplex in 2018. As far as the functionality is concerned, the Google lens allows users to search for information about visuals straight from the camera app, copy text from a picture and more. The feature was last updated in 2020, so we may see an update.\\n\\nTalking about Google Duplex, this feature is embedded in Google Assistant that can attend calls for you, book movie tickets, salon appointments and more. So Google may update this feature to be more functional.\\n\\nNew Chromecast\\n\\nA new FCC listing reveals that Google is working on a new Chromecast with a rechargeable battery. The upcoming Chromecast will likely bring support for Google Stadia. Additionally, it may have an in-built Ethernet port and better app streaming support.',\n",

              " \"Forewarned is forearmed. This maxim holds good for all nations trying to combat the waves of Covid-19 that threaten the world today. Yet the Narendra Modi government, which had acted with alacrity during the first wave, was surprisingly complacent, not keeping track of mutations of the virus that could trigger a second wave of infections—as it did in the US and the UK and is now doing in India. When the first wave raged, barring two institutes, the Delhi-based Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) and the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) in Hyderabad, there was no coordinated national effort to sequence Covid samples to detect the most dominant variants and to ascertain if any threatening mutations had occurred.\\n\\nIt was only on December 21, after the UK variant was recorded in England, that the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) formed the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) to do so. A group of 10 labs was granted funding and came under the purview of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), which reports to the MoHFW. INSACOG’s job was to track Covid variants in the country, most specifically if any of the variants causing concern in the UK, Brazil and South Africa had reached India and also track the progress of the Indian variant, B.1.617, which had been detected in October 2020 by the CCMB.\\n\\nIndia's covid collapse, part 2: How a shortage of trained medical staff crippled India’s fight against the disease\\n\\nINSACOG faced big hurdles from the start. The first major problem was a May 2020 Union finance ministry order banning the import of goods valued under Rs 200 crore. Several reagents and plastics used by Indian labs come from foreign manufacturers and have no Indian substitutes. To import any of these, a lab would have to prove to officials through a market assessment that no Indian alternative exists. The reagent restriction was lifted only in January this year. The second problem was funds. INSACOG was initially allocated Rs 115 crore for a six-month period, which was to come through the department of biotechnology. But the first tranche of funds was released only on March 31, 2021, and the allocation itself was reduced to Rs 80 crore. Till then, the labs had to spend their own resources for sequencing.\\n\\nThe third, and the biggest, problem was getting hold of samples from the states to enable the labs to track the variants. Barring Kerala, most states were lackadaisical in their approach. Covid-19 testing labs in states must preserve positive samples from patients and it is the responsibility of state governments to transport a set number of these samples to the 10 INSACOG labs every week. The problem, an official at one of the labs revealed, was that most states had not appointed nodal officers to ensure collection and transport of the samples to the labs. Some states didn’t have cold storages to preserve the samples before and during transportation. As a result, INSACOG fell far short of its objective of sequencing around 80,000 samples by February 2021—it managed to do only 3,500.\\n\\nThis was one reason why it was only in March that INSACOG could determine that the B.1.617 variant, detected months ago, had been found in a high 20 per cent of samples from Maharashtra. On March 10, the group shared its findings with the NCDC, which further conveyed it to MoHFW. In a draft statement that was never released, INSACOG wrote that the mutations in the B.1.617 variant were of “high concern”. On March 24, MoHFW announced the variant’s spread but played down concerns to avoid public panic. Many experts believe this cost them dearly. “That the variant was spreading and was more contagious didn’t ring alarm bells till it was too late. People continued to gather in groups without masks and social distancing,” says Rakesh Mishra, director, CCMB.\\n\\nMissing the alarm bells\\n\\nThe Centre claims it had taken note of INSACOG’s warnings. Ashutosh Sharma, secretary, department of science and technology, says the B.1.617 strain was discussed in an early April meeting with 21 members of the National Task Force for Covid. The task force had been set up in April 2020 to provide scientific and technical guidance to the government and is headed by Dr V.K. Paul. Its members include Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) director general Dr Balram Bhargava, AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria and NCDC director Sujeet Kumar Singh. In that meeting, around 100,000 daily new cases were predicted, with the peak of the second wave in end-April. Yet, the experts seemed to have severely underestimated the virulence of the mutant strains. Within 20 days of the meeting, India hit 300,000 new cases a day.\\n\\nIndia's covid collapse, part 3: Lack of health infrastructure exacerbates the situation\\n\\nOn April 19, NCDC director Singh met other members of the National Task Force for Covid. The minutes of the meeting, doing the rounds of social media, purportedly had Singh saying that the lockdown should have been announced 15 days ago. A task force member who att\\xadended the early April meeting says the severity of the second wave went unnoticed. “The predictions were based on how infectious the first wave had been and the modelling of the second wave mirrored the first. That the Indian variant replaced the early strain in Maharashtra in just 1.5 months was not used to predict how rapidly the second wave would spread,” he says.\\n\\nLessons from the UK\\n\\nAs the B.1.617 strain is showing signs of a third mutation in West Bengal and a new variant, N440K, has come up in Andhra Pradesh, the need for quick and widespread genome sequencing has never been greater. India can learn from the UK’s research consortium—COG-UK. The group was created as soon as the pandemic began in March 2020. It has been allocated £32 million (Rs 329 crore), about four times what was given in India. In the first wave itself, the group found out that Covid in the UK came from France and Spain, not Italy or China. To find out if certain viral variants are linked with more severe diseases, COG-UK is linking its viral genome sequences with NHS (National Health Service) patient data and a human genome sequencing project being carried out with Genomics England. Their work is so precise that in Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge, the group identified that an outbreak in the area was due to a bus transporting dialysis patients.\\n\\nScientists say genome sequencing can pick up outbreaks at least two weeks faster than any other surveillance, by ascertaining if cases in an area are linked. Say, if all five cases are related, it is possible that there is active transmission, which means a containment zone should be created immediately.\\n\\nIndia has already built up its capacity to do this work. At CCMB, sequencing to identify a variant can now be done in 24 hours. But many of the labs assigned to do this work are not receiving samples from states fast enough to draw a conclusive picture of variants and their spread. Some states, like Goa, are setting up their own sequencing facilities. Rapid surveillance of Covid variants followed by immediate policy action on points of concern is the only way to prevent a repeat of April 2021 and stem the damage a third wave may cause.\\n\\nWe uncovered the ten reasons behind India's Covid crisis for this week's cover story. This is the first point in the cover story series.\",\n",
              " \"When a harried Naresh Indulkar, a resident of Mumbai’s Thane, went searching for three vials of Remdesivir for a relative in critical condition in hospital, it took nearly six hours to find a pharmacy with stock. “Rs 22,000 a vial,” whispered the man behind the counter, though the marked retail price was only Rs 1,800. Distraught, Indulkar returned to his apartment. A glimmer of hope appeared in the form of a reply from his neighbour to an appeal he had posted on his residential society’s WhatsApp group. On calling him, the neighbour came up two floors and offered Indulkar three spare vials of Remdesivir he had. “He had bought eight vials—at a premium—to treat his father,” recalls Indulkar. “Five sufficed, and as thanksgiving, he offered me the rest at the marked price, unmindful of his financial loss.”\\n\\nFew have been as lucky. After Majid Sabir of Prayagraj was admitted to a hospital in Kanpur, his son Abdul, after doing the rounds of medical stores in the city in search of Remdesivir, was told to meet the district CMO (chief medical officer), Dr Anil Kumar Mishra, to see if supplies could be allotted to his father. However, as Abdul waited to meet the CMO, he received a call from the hospital informing him that his father had passed away.\\n\\nIndia's covid collapse, part 7: Why did we face an acute oxygen shortage?\\n\\nTo deal with the crisis, Uttar Pradesh has authorised district magistrates and chief medical officers in every district to allot Remdesivir injections to patients admitted to private hospitals. However, highlighting the scarce supplies of the medicine, Dr Saurabh Sonkar of the Lucknow Medical Association says, “They do not give [allotment] letters easily, and even after that, the [medicine] may not issued, depending on the [condition] of the patient.” State health authorities deny any shortage. Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar, CMO of Lucknow, says, “Private hospitals administer Remdesivir incorrectly. This is why there is a spurt in demand and people are at a loss trying to get it.”\\n\\nThe story of medicine shortages is similar across the country. On May 4, the Jodhpur bench of the Rajasthan High Court, responding to a PIL (public interest litigation), ordered the Rajasthan government to issue Remdesivir to patients within two hours of requisition. (The state government has taken over control of the distribution of Remdesivir, Tocilizumab and a few other critical medicines. Under this system, the Rajasthan Medical Services Corporation sources stocks and issues them to patients after its allotment committee has scrutinised the requisition, which includes the patient’s medical history.) Unfortunately, many see this crisis as an opportunity to make a quick buck. In Bhopal, three people have been arrested for selling Remdesivir injections in the black market, even as 800 vials of the medicine went missing from the government-run Gandhi Medical College drug store. In Hyderabad, five men have been arrested for manufacturing and selling fake vials.\\n\\nIndia's covid collapse, part 8: Why the vaccine rollout is so slow\\n\\nThis shortage is the result of several factors, including a reduction in production due to low demand toward the end of last year and a failure on the part of the government to ensure that an emergency stockpile was built and maintained. Gilead Life Sciences, the inventor of this drug, had licensed seven manufacturers to produce it in India last year. They are Cipla, Hetero Drugs, Zydus Cadila, Mylan Labs, Dr Reddy’s Labs, Syngene and Jubilant Ingrevia. Sources say that with demand falling to almost nothing at the end of last year, production slackened as well. The speed at which cases have surged, and the sheer number of new cases—currently almost 400,000 per day—caught manufacturers and distributors off guard, quickly depleting whatever stocks had been built up.\\n\\nWhen production resumed in March, the government allowed manufacturers to increase their output. Of them, Hetero Drugs was the largest manufacturer, producing about 1.3 million vials a month, followed by Cipla (760,000), Zydus Cadila (610,000), Mylan Labs (500,000) and Dr Reddy’s Labs, Syngene and Jubilant Ingrevia (240,000 each). In the last week of April, the government approved another 25 Remdesivir manufacturing sites to increase output to over 9 million vials a month. “About ten of these manufacturing units have begun production,” says Daara B. Patel, secretary-general of the Indian Drug Manufacturers Association. Mansukh Mandaviya, minister of state for chemicals and fertilisers, says that once these facilities are online, India will have nearly tripled its production capacity of Remdesivir, “and will soon be able to meet the growing demand.” HLL Lifecare, a government PSU in the medical sector, has also ordered 450,000 vials of Remdesivir from Gilead Sciences USA and Eva Pharma, an Egyptian pharma firm. The first consignment of 75,000 vials has already arrived.\\n\\nIndia's covid collapse, part 9: Why hasn't a centralised war room been set up yet?\\n\\nTo ensure that domestic production proceeds apace, the department of revenue, on April 20, waived customs duties on Remdesivir, its active pharmaceutical ingredient and Beta-cyclodextrin, a chemical used in its manufacture, till October 31. And in an attempt to put an end to price gouging, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority on April 17 put a cap on the price of the medicine at Rs 3,500.\\n\\nOn April 30, the Supreme Court also asked whether the Centre had considered invoking the Patents Act to improve the availability of Covid-19 medicines by bypassing patent protections to allow increased domestic production of lifesaving drugs. Remdesivir is only one of several medicines that are currently in short supply—others include Tocilizumab and Ivermectin. Along with the critical shortage of oxygen, this crisis of supply has made the pandemic measurably more dangerous for Indian citizens.\\n\\nWe uncovered the ten reasons behind India's Covid crisis for this week's cover story.

              " 'In 1748, Montesquieu published L’Espirit des Lois or The Spirit of Laws, which introduced the theory of separation of powers and formed the basic foundation of several constitutions, including that of India. The State that most effectively promotes liberty is one where the legislative, executive and judicial powers are entrusted to different bodies that act independently of each other.\\n\\nAfter the Emergency of 1975-77, the advent of public interest litigation (PIL) brought the judiciary centre stage. While PILs played a salutary role in releasing 40,000 under-trial prisoners, checking pollution and preventing deforestation, the judiciary was increasingly petitioned to resolve almost every major crisis. The 19th century political philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville famously remarked: “There is scarcely any political question in the United States that does not ultimately resolve itself into a judicial question.” In India, there is scarcely any controversy or crisis that does not become the subject matter of a PIL.\\n\\nThe second wave of the Covid-19 crisis once again witnessed a flurry of writ petitions. No less than eight high courts have passed far-reaching orders that include directions not to supply Remdesivir to private hospitals till the state hospitals have a sufficient supply; to ‘centralise’ its procurement, allocation and distribution; divert industrial oxygen for use of the people and to take action against private hospitals and pharmaceutical companies. The Allahabad High Court went to the extent of declaring a lockdown in five major cities of Uttar Pradesh. These orders, albeit well-intentioned, are really in the executive domain.\\n\\nOn April 30, the Supreme Court passed a 64-page order with a slew of directions in a suo motu petition. While those that directed full access to hospitals and prohibited any clampdown on sharing information on social media platforms are welcome, the central government was also directed to examine the possibility of price control of essential drugs, of compulsory licensing and to revisit the initiatives and protocols on the availability of oxygen, vaccines and essential drugs at affordable prices. In this order, the Supreme Court repeatedly emphasised that it did not want to delve into the role of the executive in designing policy choices; it was merely seeking to enter into a dialogue with the relevant stakeholders in order to ensure the probity and transparency of the measures underway.\\n\\nThis is the right time to revisit the role of courts in resolving national problems. The power of policy-making must be left to the legislature and the executive. As Lord Sumption put it, “litigation is not a consultative or participatory process”. The court’s task is only to see if a policy is violative of a statutory or constitutional provision. The courts can also direct compliance with executive orders; the Delhi High Court rightly issued directions to ensure that the national capital received its allocated quota of oxygen. The courts can and should interfere if there is, for example, discriminatory pricing for vaccines or there is non-implementation of a policy provision or a statutory safeguard.\\n\\nIn a seminal essay published in the 1978 Harvard Law Review titled, ‘The Forms and Limits of Adjudication’, Prof. Lon Fuller points out that a “polycentric situation” is like a spider’s web and has many strands. A pandemic is a classic example of a polycentric situation that has multiple dimensions. Such a crisis can only be resolved by the executive or the legislature. The judiciary simply does not have the data or the domain expertise to arrive at a satisfactory solution.\\n\\nThe trend of taking frequent recourse to the high courts and the Supreme Court must be checked; courts must not take on the task of supervising the formation of a policy or issuing directions that are executive in nature. These are tasks that our Constitution never intended the courts to perform. To quote Lord Sumption again: “The rule of law does not mean that every human problem calls for a legal solution.\\n\\nArvind P.

              " 'India wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav has conceded that he misses MS Dhoni\\'s guidance from behind the stumps as the former captain\\'s retirement has coincided with his dip in form in international cricket. Kuldeep, who has played only 2 ODIs and a Test in 2021 conceded that he has been low on confidence after not getting enough game time both at the international level and at the Indian Premier League.\\n\\nKuldeep Yadav said a wrist-spinner like him loves bowling with partners and pointed out that Yuzvendra Chahal and he haven\\'t played a lot together since MS Dhoni retired from international cricket. Notably, Kuldeep and Chahal have spoken in the past about the impact wicketkeeper Dhoni has had on their games.\\n\\nAs Kuldeep points out, the wrist-spin bowlers have played 44 matches together but none after MS Dhoni played his last international game at the 2019 World Cup. Kuldeep\\'s form has taken a massive dip as the 26-year-old has been left out of India\\'s squad for the World Test Championship final and the subsequent Test series against England. The Kolkata Knight Riders spinner did not get a game in now-suspended IPL 2021 despite the former champions playing in spin-friendly wickets in Chennai.\\n\\n\"Sometimes I miss that guidance because he (Mahi) has great experience. He used to guide us behind the wicket, kept screaming! We miss his experience. Rishabh is there now, the more he plays, the more input he will give in the future. I always felt every bowler needs a partner who can respond from the other end,\" Kuldeep told The Indian Express.\\n\\n\"When Mahibhai was there, I and Chahal were playing. Ever since Mahi bhai left, Chahal and I haven\\'t played together. I played only a handful of games after Mahibhai left. I must have played ten-odd games. I had even taken a hat-trick. If you look at the performance as a whole, it will look pretty decent but if one breaks it up then my performance sometimes can look not up to the mark. One has to also look at the opposition we are playing against,\" he added.\\n\\nHead coach Ravi Shastri had marked Kuldeep Yadav as the team\\'s No.1 spinner in overseas conditions after his 5-wicket haul in Sydney. However, Kuldeep did not play a single Test for more than 2 years. He got an opportunity to play Tests against England at home earlier this year but the wrist-spinner conceded he felt a lot of pressure during his comeback Test.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t play as many matches as I expected to, and somewhere I was low on confidence. When you are playing non-stop, players do feel high on confidence. The more one sits out the more it gets tougher. I felt a huge pressure on me when I played the Test against England in Chennai this February,\" Kuldeep said.\\n\\nAm I that bad? Kuldeep on lack of games at KKR\\n\\nKuldeep hasn\\'t benefitted from the lack of chances at his IPL franchise, KKR. The young spinner said he started questioning his quality after being benched for IPL 2021 matches in Chennai. Notably, KKR played veteran spinner Harbhajan Singh, Sunil Narine and Varun Chakravarthy but did not give a single game to Kuldeep.\\n\\n\"I was especially (depressed) when I didn\\'t find a place in my IPL team Kolkata Knight Riders. I wondered, \\'am I that bad?\\' It\\'s a team-management decision and it would be wrong to go and ask them. I wasn\\'t played in Chennai during the IPL despite knowing it\\'s a turner. I was a bit shocked but couldn\\'t do anything,\" he added.\\n\\nAfter having missed the berth to England, Kuldeep Yadav is likely to get a place in the squad for Sri Lanka tour. India will field their white-ball specialists for 3 ODIs and as many T20Is vs Sri Lanka in July during which the Test specialists, including captain Virat Kohli, will be in the UK preparing for the 5-Test series against England.',\n",

Intel says that its new 11th Gen Tiger Lake-H processors pack three eight-core chips and two six-core chips.\\n\\nIntel's 11th Gen top-of-line model is the Core i9-11980HK, which the company claims to be the World's Best Gaming Laptop Processor, though this is yet to be verified by reviewers. The Intel Core i9-11980HK claims to deliver the highest performance in laptops for gaming, content creators and business professionals, reaching speeds up to 5GHz.\\n\\nAt launch, the company claimed that the new 11th Gen Intel Core Mobile H-series and Intel Xeon W-11000 series processors would power over 80 laptops across categories including consumer, commercial and workstation segments in 2021.\\n\\nIntel claims that the central processing unit (CPU) can directly access high-speed GDDR6 memory attached to the graphics card, which can enable gamers to experience higher framerates with lower latency and load large textures faster.\\n\\nFor gamers, Intel claims that the new flagship Core i9-11980HK can deliver excellent performance when compared to its predecessor Comet Lake processor.

              " 'The interested buyers need to understand that any medical equipment can be confusing and should be bought only after proper advise.\\n\\nThe number of new Covid-19 cases in India might have come down to 3.29 lakh but, the situation remains to be of concern. There are number of patients dealing with breathing issues as hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and other facilities remain difficult to find. Oxygen concentrators, that provide temporary relief, also remain in high demand. The challenge is that only till a few months back, not many people knew about them or understood them properly. Now, most of them have to buy one.\\n\\nThe interested buyers need to understand that any medical equipment can be confusing and should be bought only after proper advise. The oxygen concentrators are the same. They come in different sizes, have varied flow rates and serve distinct purposes. On top it, there are a number of scams happening across the country which buyers need to be aware of.\\n\\nSo, just buying one oxygen concentrator isn’t enough. The buyers should know what they are spending on.\\n\\nCAPACITY IS IMPORTANT\\n\\nThe efficiency of an oxygen concentrator depends on its capacity. They come in different sizes 5L and 10L available more accessible. A 5L oxygen cylinder can provide 5 litres of oxygen in a minute, while the 10L concentrator can provide 10 litres of oxygen in a minute. The first should be enough for patients with mild symptoms and basic requirements but, we will advise you to buy 10L concentrators better efficiency. Also, the buyers need to keep in mind that a 5L concentrator will not be enough if there are more than one patient at home.\\n\\nAt the same time, if the patient has to travel or has to be admitted in a hospital, the 5L portable oxygen concentrators can be handier during the journey. They pack a batter and don’t need a power source all the time.\\n\\nCONCENRATION LEVEL IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT\\n\\nAll oxygen concentrators have different oxygen concentration level. Some of them promise has 87 per cent oxygen, while others promise the same up to 93 per cent. The Covid-19 affected patients usually need 90 to 94 per cent of concentrated oxygen. So, it will be best if you opt for the concentrator that can deliver around 93 per cent oxygen concentration.\\n\\nMany sellers try to pass off the lower concentration level machines for a higher rate. The buyers need to be check this before paying. This is important because if the level is 80 and the concentrator can supply 10 litre oxygen per minute, it won’t be really helpful.\\n\\nOPT FOR QUALITY\\n\\nThere are a number of brands and websites that are selling oxygen concentrators in the country. Not all of them promise quality. The buyers should look to buy from authorised sellers and retailers. If the weight of the concentrator is less than 14-15kgs, there is a high chance that it of poor quality.\\n\\nThe price should also expose poor quality products. Chinese and Indian brands with 5L per minute capacity are selling for around Rs 50,000 to Rs 55,000. Philips sells only one model in India, and its market price is around Rs 65,000. For a 10L Chinese brand concentrator, the price is around Rs 95,000 to Rs 1.10 Lakhs. For an American brand concentrator, the price is between Rs 1.50 lakh to Rs 1.75 lakh.\\n\\nIf the prices are off this range, then that’s a red flag.\\n\\nDOGE THE SCAM\\n\\nThe biggest challenge for buyers and patients right now is to not fall for a scam. Multiple cases have already been exposed where sellers were trying to charge extra money or were selling low-quality products at a high rate. The best possible solution may be purchasing through e-commerce platforms. But, even that’s not entirely safe.\\n\\nThe Delhi police recently arrested a man who took over Rs 1 lakh via bank transfers for two oxygen concentrators but, never delivered them. Another one in Mumbai used the GST number of a reputed textiles firm in the invoices that he issued to fool people. There have been other reports where customers have been asked to pay in advance on WhatsApp or social media but were not delivered the products. Some got fault concentrators.\\n\\nMany sellers are also trying to sell humidifiers — hello Dedakj — as oxygen concentrators. Read the details very carefully before buying.\\n\\nWe would once again like to highlight that you should only look to purchase an oxygen concentrator from a trusted website or source. Also, please consult your doctor or hospital to understand the exact needs of the patient and make the purchase accordingly.',\n",

              " 'Late last month, when the Centers for Disease Control eased its mask guidelines for vaccinated people venturing outdoors, the New York Times story on the announcement had a striking statistic:\\n\\n\"The study concluded that fewer than 10 percent of infections occurred outdoors, and that the odds for indoor transmission were 18.7 times as high as outdoors (the odds of super-spreading events were 33 times as high as indoors).\"\\n\\nThe Times had plenty of company. All kinds of news outlets repeated the figure, framed as an easing of CDC advice to encourage people to get the Covid-19 vaccine—with the prospect that they could enjoy outdoor life largely mask-free.\\n\\nBut if you stop and look at it, \"fewer than 10 percent of infections\" occurring outdoors is not all that comforting. That would mean you’d have as much as a 1 in 10 chance of contracting a deadly disease while walking around.\\n\\nWell, yesterday the Times did a difficult thing for a newspaper, challenging the CDC for peddling garbage.\\n\\nDavid Leonhardt, a former Washington bureau chief, called the Biden administration’s number \"almost certainly misleading,\" and backed it up.\\n\\nHe lambasted \"the extreme caution of CDC officials\" for setting the level at 10 percent, so high that no one could challenge it. In fact, writes Leonhardt, citing discussions with multiple epidemiologists, \"the share of transmission that has occurred outdoors seems to be below 1 percent, and may be below 0.1 percent.\"\\n\\nWell, it might have been nice to know that a year ago, though perhaps the science wasn’t clear at that time.\\n\\nSOME PROBLEMS ARE MOUNTING, BUT A MAJORITY SEE AMERICA ON THE RIGHT TRACK\\n\\nThis is not just a nerdy dispute over math. The Times quotes one virologist as saying the CDC \"seems to be a huge exaggeration.\" But it’s part of a pattern by the ultra-cautious agency that may well be discouraging many people from getting their shots—at a time when vaccination rates have plunged.\\n\\nWhat’s the point of going to the time and trouble of getting a vaccine if you still have to mask up outdoors? I’m not talking here about walking into a crowd, but about strolling through a park or just window-shopping. Even Anthony Fauci, who’s also seen by critics as too cautious, is now saying the feds have to be more \"liberal\" in describing the payoff from vaccination.\\n\\nIn reality, says Leonhardt, \"the rare outdoor transmission that has happened almost all seems to have involved crowded places or close conversation. Saying that less than 10 percent of Covid transmission occurs outdoors is akin to saying that sharks attack fewer than 20,000 swimmers a year. (The actual worldwide number is around 150.) It’s both true and deceiving.\"\\n\\nIn my view, the slow pace of vaccinations is the biggest single reason why we may fall short in vanquishing the virus. Some people have legitimate concerns or see themselves as too busy. But, like mask-wearing, it’s also become a partisan issue, with conservatives among the most reluctant groups. The states with the highest rates of participation are blue strongholds; those with the lowest are red states.\\n\\nBiden announced a range of new measures yesterday, including free rides from Uber and Lyft, and community colleges hosting vax sites. Buffalo had success in giving away free beer; Maryland and West Virginia are offering $100 incentives; New Yorkers can get free Yankees or Mets tickets.\\n\\nThe administration should have been better prepared, since it’s been known for months that supply would outstrip demand by May. If a couple of brewskis can entice people to get the shots, there are still lots of persuadable folks out there.\\n\\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE\\'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY\\'S HOTTEST STORIES\\n\\nOn the encouraging side, the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of a Pfizer vaccine for kids 11 through 15 should help them and their families. And there should be a blitz to get many of them vaccinated—with their parents’ permission—before the school year ends and they start scattering.\\n\\nPerhaps the Times piece, if widely picked up, will entice more people who are sitting on the fence. But with all the conflicting advice and partisan filters out there, it may just add to the confusion.',\n",

It may not be wise to let your guard down since an increasing number of people are continuing to experience symptoms after their initial recovery from the disease in the second wave.\\n\\nThese post-Covid health conditions or complications have come to be known as \"long Covid\" or \"long-haul Covid\". In such cases, a patient continues to experience symptoms of the disease four weeks after initial recovery.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome of the complications being witnessed in patients recovered from Covid-19 include impact on lungs, kidneys, heart, and cases of a black fungal infection, called mucormycosis.\\n\\nHere is everything you need to know about possible complications that may arise post Covid-19 infection and what precautions one should take before resuming normal life:\\n\\n(Infographic : India Today/Rahul Gupta)\\n\\nWhen can we say that a Covid-19 patient is cured and can resume normal life?\\n\\nDr Syamasis Bandyopadhyay, Senior Consultant Physician and Rheumatologist, Director Medical Services, Apollo Hospitals, said if a Covid-19 patient has ILI (Influenza-like illness) symptoms, then within 10 days of onset of symptoms he becomes non-infectious.\\n\\n\"After 17 days from the onset of symptoms, he can resume normal activities while maintaining Covid-appropriate behaviour.

They stimulate the fibroblasts, causing fibrosis of the lungs and that is a tripling problem. That is, you land up with a \\'triple lung\\', leading to fatigue and you always pant for breath,\" he said.\\n\\nREAD | Why post-recovery symptoms could prove dangerous for Covid-19 survivors\\n\\nWhat has the Health Ministry recommended as post-Covid management protocol?\\n\\nIn its post-Covid management protocol, the Health Ministry says the first follow-up visit (physical/telephonic) for a recovered patient should be within seven days after discharge.\\n\\n\"Subsequent treatment/follow-up visits may be with the nearest qualified allopathic/AYUSH practitioner/medical facility of other systems of medicine. Poly-therapy (use of multiple medications) is to be avoided due to the potential for unknown drug-drug interaction, which may lead to Serious Adverse Events (SAE) or Adverse Effects (AE),\" the protocol says.\\n\\nIf there is a persistent dry cough or sore throat, the Health Ministry recommends saline gargles (with turmeric and salt) and steam inhalation. Cough medication should be taken on the advice of a doctor.\\n\\nWhat precautions should I take after recovering from Covid-19?\\n\\nDr Syamasis Bandyopadhyay said people with co-morbidities like hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases or renal failure should immediately go back to their ongoing/pre-Covid medication.\\n\\n\"Because of Covid-19, people are stopping their normal treatment. Just because you have Covid-19, it doesn\\'t mean your diabetes has got better, or your blood pressure has improved. Secondly, after recovering, one should consult a doctor and do some tests to see whether Covid-19 has had any impact on end organs like heart, kidney, liver. He/she should get vaccinated 1-1.5 months after recovering from Covid-19,\" he said.\\n\\nOther precautions include: staying hydrated and drinking plenty of fluids, practicing breathing exercises and meditation, following a nutritious diet, getting adequate sleep, avoiding smoking and alcohol.\\n\\n(Infographic : India Today/Rahul Gupta)\\n\\nWhen can I resume workout, exercises after recovering?\\n\\nOne key concern of people after Covid-19 recovery is about the right time to resume workout sessions. \"The ideal way is to start slow and do low-intensity exercises and perform any activity for 5-10 minutes a day. You can start with jogging or walking in the first week of post-Covid recovery. In the second week, you can double the timing and increase the pace,\" said Dr Abhishek Bansal.\\n\\nThe Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) Sports Medicine Institute in New York recently published a set of guidelines for people to return safely to their workout regimen after Covid-19.\\n\\n\"Those dealing with respiratory symptoms like pneumonia, it is best to rest for a week or 10 days before resuming workout routine.

(Photo: PTI/Representational image)\\n\\nIndia might be heading towards a “serious livelihood crisis” as the situation seems to be worse this time for the working class amid the COVID crisis and local restrictions by states already add up to something close to a nationwide lockdown, according to noted economist Jean Dreze.\\n\\nIn an interview, he also said the government\\'s target to make India a USD 5 trillion economy by 2024-25 was never a “feasible target” and was just to pander to the “super-power ambitions” of the Indian elite.\\n\\nRead | V-shaped recovery unlikely as India’s economy faces tougher Covid test\\n\\nAbout the impact of the second wave of COVID on the Indian economy, the eminent economist said the situation today is not very different from what it was around this time last year as far as working people are concerned.\\n\\n“The economic consequences of local lockdowns may not be as destructive as those of a national lockdown. But in some respects, things are worse this time for the working class,” he opined.\\n\\nFurther, the eminent economist said the fear of infection is more widespread and that will make it hard to revive economic activity.\\n\\n“Despite mass vaccination, there is a serious possibility that intermittent crises will continue for a long time, perhaps years. Compared with last year, many people have depleted savings and larger debts. Those who borrowed their way through last year\\'s crisis may not be able to do it again this time,” he observed.\\n\\n‘SERIOUS LIVELIHOOD CRISIS’\\n\\nDreze also pointed out that last year there was a relief package and today relief measures are not even being discussed.\\n\\n“On top of all this, local lockdowns may give way to a national lockdown relatively soon. In fact, they already add up to something close to a country-wide lockdown. In short, we are heading towards a serious livelihood crisis,” he said.\\n\\nAlso Read | National lockdown, just not in name: Almost 98% of India is under some form of lockdown\\n\\nOn how the government could have missed seeing the second COVID-19 wave coming, Dreze said the Indian government has been in denial all along.\\n\\n“Remember, the government refused to admit about any \\'\\'community transmission\\'\\' of COVID for a long time, even as recorded cases were counted in millions. When an early analysis of official data exposed the collapse of health services, the government retracted the data,\" he said.\\n\\nHe pointed out that misleading statistics have been routinely invoked to reassure the public that all is well. “Denying a crisis is the surest way to make it worse. We are now paying the price of this complacency”.\\n\\nIndia has been reporting more than three lakh new COVID cases daily in recent weeks and the death toll due to the infection is also rising.\\n\\nHEALTH, SOCIAL SECURITY BOOST NEEDED\\n\\nNoting that India is also paying the price of a long history of neglect of the health sector, especially public health, Dreze said nothing is more important than health for the quality of life, yet public expenditure on health in India has hovered around a measly 1 per cent of GDP for decades.\\n\\nWhen asked about the sort of relief measures that could be put in place to deal with possible livelihood crisis, he said as a starter, the central government could replay the 2020 relief package.\\n\\n\"But it is important to go beyond that, and to consolidate the social security system on a durable basis,\" the eminent economist said, adding that ad-hoc, short-term relief measures tend to breed confusion, corruption and waste.\\n\\nDreze, who was also part of the National Advisory Council (NAC) that had advised the previous UPA government, said much can be done within the framework of existing social security schemes and laws such as the public distribution system, the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA), the National Social Assistance Programme, and the Integrated Child Development Services.\\n\\nAlso Read | In Covid-hit India, 23 crore people earn less than Rs 375 per day: Study\\n\\nHe also noted it would be easy to provide supplementary food rations to all ration-card holders for much longer than the proposed two months, and also to expand the coverage of the public distribution system.\\n\\n\"Going beyond existing schemes, I think that a well-designed, inclusive cash-transfer programme would be useful,\" Dreze opined.\\n\\nAccording to him, if intermittent crises are going to continue for years, which is very possible, it would really help to have a well-functioning system of cash relief that can be activated whenever the need arises.\\n\\n\"Turning India into a USD 5 trillion economy by 2024-25 was never a feasible target, and it is a useless target in any case. The function of this target is to pander to the super-power ambitions of the Indian elite,\" the Belgian-born Indian economist said.\\n\\nIn 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi envisioned to make India a USD 5 trillion economy and global powerhouse by 2024-25. According to Dreze, even if we accept GDP as a valid development indicator, the standard approach is to look at GDP at its per capita terms.\\n\\n\"But then India looks like one of the poorer countries in the world, which it is. Looking at aggregate GDP, which is naturally quite large because of India\\'s large population, creates an illusion of prosperity and power,\" he argued.\\n\\nDreze pointed out that actually, it is not entirely an illusion because if the government\\'s interest is in power on the world stage rather than in the living conditions of the people, then, yes, aggregate GDP would matter.\\n\\n\"For instance, it would enable you maintain a large army.

              " 'Covid-19 vaccines protect against serious illness but transmissibility can still take place and inoculated people can pass on the infection to others. That is why experts warn against complacency by people after they get their jabs.\\n\\nOne of the mistakes people make is not wearing the mask or letting their guard down once they get vaccinated. That is when they are most susceptible. After getting vaccinated, it takes about two weeks in most cases to develop antibodies.\\n\\n“You basically become an asymptomatic carrier or a mild carrier,\" said Dr Aviral Roy, consultant, Critical Care, Medica Superspecialty Hospital, Kolkata.\\n\\nLive TV Doctors have time and again said that vaccines create antibodies in the blood while the virus causes infection in the nose. They have stressed the need for masks and physical distance regardless of one\\'s vaccination status. Live TV READ | You can get Covid-19 even after getting two doses of vaccine. But there is no need to panic There are various theories on why getting the vaccine does not mean one cannot contract Covid-19.\\n\\nFirst dose of Covid-19 vaccine produces mini cytokine storm\\n\\nSpeaking to India Today TV, Dr Raja Dhar, head of the pulmonology department at CK Birla Hospital in Kolkata, said the second hypothesis why people contract Covid-19 after getting the first dose is that it produces a mini cytokine storm.\\n\\n“The vaccine produces a mini cytokine storm. Suppose an asymptomatic carrier and I go take the vaccine and the coronavirus is in the upper airway. The vaccine acts as a booster for an asymptomatic carrier which enhances the fever and other symptoms,\" he said.\\n\\nThere could be credence to this as the time between getting the vaccine and dropping guard post-vaccination could be less, added Dhar.\\n\\n\\'Covid-19 vaccine given in the muscle, protection is primarily in blood\\'\\n\\nThe Covid-19 vaccine is given intramuscularly and the protection is primarily in the blood, said Dr Aviral Roy. “When the virus enters your system, it enters through the nose. The vaccine in its current form does not prevent getting the infection because it is not creating antibodies in the nose. You are creating antibodies in the blood,\" explained Dr Roy.\\n\\nThe immune system has local immunity in the nose, mouth and saliva, which one does not get in the respiratory tract. “This immunity does not come with the injectable vaccine. Hence, even if one does contract Covid-19, the antibodies in the blood quickly shut down the infection, and hence the infection is much less,\" added Dr Roy.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine can do?\\n\\nOne dose of Covid-19 prevents people from 50-60% of the infection becoming severe post two weeks of being vaccinated. Some doctors said it protects people by up to 70-85% from getting a severe infection. The second dose prevents people by almost 95% from being severely infected.\\n\\n“Taking the vaccine is a no-brainer decision. If you have access to the vaccine and have signed up, you should take the vaccine. The vaccine does not prevent you from getting sick, it prevents you from getting Covid-19. This is a proven fact. Also if you do get sick, the vaccine prevents you from getting the severe disease,\" said Dr Aviral Roy.\\n\\nHe further said that even with one dose of Covid-19 vaccine, the likelihood of landing up in the ICU is considerably reduced.\\n\\n“You might still get mild disease like cough, cold and running nose and it will be like a common cold. But the likelihood of getting pneumonia and landing up in the ICU needing oxygen and ventilator is reduced even with one dose of the vaccine,\" he said.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Dr Raja Dhar believes there are two hypotheses behind people getting infected after getting vaccinated.\\n\\n“The protection you get from the first dose of vaccine is miniscule. However, people perceive that the protection they get from a single dose is significant. So they drop their guard and get Covid-19. That is the most commonly suggested line,\" Dr Dhar said.\\n\\nAlso Read | Covid third wave may never come if we take strong measures, implement them well: Govt\\n\\nAlso Read | Covid spreads in villages: How best can India fight this challenge?',\n",

Karwal was known for his contribution to the Indian electronics space. He was known for bringing LG Corp into India in 1997 and transforming the company as their VP of Sales and Marketing. He was known for his brand-building efforts at LG, ONIDA, Philips and Electrolux, where he became part of the senior management. Milagrow was set up in 2007 for management consultancy and by 2012 the company transitioned to making robots for residential and industrial use.\\n\\nMilagrow’s robots were of significance during Covid times as hospitals started using Milagrow’s humanoid to help doctors. The first hospital humanoid ELF was deployed in the advanced COVID-19 ward at AIIMS, Delhi to shield doctors and healthcare care workers from infecting the virus.\\n\\nKarwal, in his recent interviews, had spoken about Milagrow’s growth, which did well in the backdrop of the pandemic as the demand for robots increased for house help as well as for educational purposes.\\n\\nKarwal’s career spanned over three decades as an entrepreneur.

              " \"Remember Shiba Inu? Yes, the dog that has its face on Dogecoin. It has its own cryptocurrency now, and it is ruling the internet, already. Seems like Dogecoin wasn’t the last meme cryptocurrency. Shiba Inu coin is built of Ethereum and is the highest growing cryptocurrency among the top 100 coins in terms of market capitalisation. Positioned as an alternative to Dogecoin, Shiba Inu coin has given 1,970.57 per cent returns (at the time of writing) in the last seven days.\\n\\nThe surge should not come as a surprise and should be the only reason to invest in this coin, as exponential growth is common among newly introduced cryptocurrencies. This is because of their comparatively lesser value. The value of Shiba Inu is currently sitting at $0.00000163, compared to a lower $0.0000006 in mid-April, according to CoinMarketCap.\\n\\nIt’s the market cap of this new coin which is drawing a lot of eyeballs. Shiba Inu is valued at a staggering $13 billion. In comparison, Dogecoin is valued at $61 billion. The latter had gone up till $90 billion but has fallen since, especially after Dogefather Elon Musk’s Saturday Night Live appearance.\\n\\nOne major difference between the two currencies is that while Dogecoin is a coin, Shiba Inu is a token. The difference between the two is that cryptocurrencies have their own blockchains, whereas crypto tokens are built on an existing blockchain. Shiba Inu coin is sold as SHIB tokens.\\n\\nAs mentioned before, it is based on Ethereum. And, at this moment, Ethereum’s founder Vitalik Buterin seems to be the biggest beneficiary of SHIB’s rise. The price surge has added a whopping $11 billion to his net worth. Buterin holds over 505 billion SHIB tokens representing 50% of its total supply.\\n\\nInterestingly, he didn’t even buy them. He got them as part of a ‘give away’ from Shiba Inu’s creators. This was done to remove them from circulation and create an element of scarcity for the tokens.\\n\\n“We sent over 50% of the TOTAL supply to Vitalik. There is no greatness without a vulnerable point and as long as VB doesn’t rug us, then SHIBA will grow and survive,” said the SHIB founder in company’s white paper.\\n\\nApart from this, not much is known about SHIB. According to its website, they're cryptocurrency tokens and allow users to hold trillions of them.\\n\\nCan you buy Shib Inu coin in India?\\n\\nNot on the Indian trading platforms. The token is not listed on major Indian crypto trading platforms like WazirX, Coinswitch Kuber and CoinDCX GO. The interested investors will have to make purchase through CoinDCX, Binance, and Coinbase for now. However, if the trend continues and SHIB might soon be listed on Indian platforms as well.\",\n",
              " \"Vivo recently put its new entrant Vivo V21 up for sales in India at Rs 29,990. At this cost, the company promises a device that is capable of handling your everyday functions, features new uses for existing smartphone technologies and is largely appealing to the eyes. The smartphone is largely meant to please almost every type of buyer looking for a phone in this budget.\\n\\nTo much extent, it achieves what it set out for. We have had a chance to experience the Vivo V21 for the past couple of weeks. We shared our first experience with the device a while back, and in case you want an overview of what to expect from the Vivo V21, you can read it here.\\n\\nThis review is meant to be a more extensive look at what Vivo's latest device has to offer. For that, its strong points shall be highlighted, but more importantly, its shortcomings nitpicked, and comparisons shall be made to other offerings in the category. After all, you would want to know all about it before investing your money in the smartphone.\\n\\nIn this regard, the Vivo V21 has tough parameters to beat. The simplest reason for this is the hoard of launches in the budget of around Rs 30,000. Almost every smartphone maker is present in this category, from OnePlus, Oppo, Xiaomi, Realme to even Apple with its iPhone SE.\\n\\nIf that wasn't enough, the Vivo V21 also has to compete with its own brethren, including the almost similar Vivo V20 Pro and the recently launched iQOO 7.\\n\\nSo what does Vivo V21 have to offer that sets it apart from the rest? Here is a look.\\n\\nVivo V21 review: Out of the box\\n\\nVivo has tried to make the V21 as premium, at least in looks, as is possible in the budget. The attempt can be seen right on the box in which the device comes. It is stark blue, it is shiny, and it will catch your eye.\\n\\nPop open the box to be impressed even more, as the moment you take the Vivo V21 out of its wraps, you will know you have a well-thought-of gadget in your hand. The looks are as refined as it gets, and the form factor is a joy to behold.\\n\\nVivo V21 comes in three colour options - Sunset Dazzle, Dusk Blue, and Arctic White. We received the Arctic White, and we can easily say that the shiny colour gradient is extremely pleasing and should appeal to all.\\n\\nIt is further complemented by the seemingly metallic highlights on the camera module as well as the edges, with their physical buttons. As for the former, this is a similar module that is seen on the recent Vivo and iQOO devices - a triple-lens set up in a rectangular housing that does not protrude much.\\n\\nThe Vivo V21 hence lies almost flat when kept on its back. This the least of the handling advantages of the smartphone. Vivo introduced the device as India's slimmest 5G smartphone yet, and at just 7.3 mm of thickness, you wouldn't care at all if the claim is true or not. You will love it.\\n\\nAnother big plus is the ultra-lightweight - at just 176 grams. All this makes the Vivo V21 a delightful smartphone to use on an everyday basis. No nonsense extra-large displays on big-case like smartphones. The V21 compacts everything it has in an easy-to-use format for all ages.\\n\\nThe design of the smartphone has been developed keeping such a use in mind. Even with its dual-tone back, the V21 comes with a matte finish, thus entirely doing away with problems like ultra-reflective backs or fingerprint smudges.\\n\\nThe rest of the device is just what smartphones are supposed to be. It houses a waterdrop selfie shooter at the front, an extremely thin bezel, USB Type-C port, dual SIM tray and speakers at the chin and a power button and a volume rocker at the right edge. The phone misses out on a 3.5 mm headphone jack.\\n\\nVivo V21 review: Performance\\n\\nAs you fire it up, you are greeted by a 6.44-inch AMOLED display with a 90Hz refresh rate, 2400x1080 pixels resolution and 500 nits of peak brightness. The display is as good as it seems to be on papers.\\n\\nAll those specifications can provide a dynamic viewing experience on the Vivo V21. The display is clear, bright enough for any lighting condition and offers vivid colours. You can easily binge-watch on the phone or play games with heavy graphics to your heart's contempt.\\n\\nWhat you also see upon setup completion is Vivo's Funtouch 11.1 based on Android 11. Now Vivo has gained strides in developing its operating system over the years, and as a result, it stands tall as a smooth and presentable OS for its smartphones. That doesn't mean it is past any room for improvement.\\n\\nFor instance, the issue of bloatware lingers on, making you compromise on space, battery life as well as performance. Then there are constantly annoying notifications from preloaded apps like Dailyhunt and V-app store. At present, we have close to 20 notifications from the V-app store that came in today.\\n\\nOther than the OS, the phone uses a 7nm MediaTek Dimensity 800U chipset for processing power. Vivo clocked speeds of up to 2.4GHz on the processor and claimed it to provide faster app load times and better connectivity.\\n\\nWe found that to be true most of the times. Vivo V21 is pretty seamless to operate and is able to open, close, run any large application you might have with ease. Daily functioning is easily taken care of.\\n\\nWe experienced lag on the V21 only occasionally in all our operating time. This included non-responsive apps and game lags on isolated incidents.\\n\\nThe phone also heats upon a demanding use. We experienced this while clicking images through its camera and while gaming. Though it gets back to a normal temperature shortly after, the heat dissipation is not as good as you see on many other smartphones.\\n\\nTo enhance its performance, Vivo has also introduced the extendable RAM capability on the V21. The technology makes the 8GB RAM variant act like an 11GB RAM device and the 12GB one like a 15GB RAM smartphone. It basically uses some part of the storage memory for processing when need be. Though we are not sure how well it works, considering the occasional lags as mentioned above.\\n\\nAll this performance is backed by a 4000mAh battery that is enough to last you a day. In fact, the phone also charges pretty quickly, thanks to the 33W fast charging support.\\n\\nVivo V21 review: Camera\\n\\nBy now, there is a chance that you have already seen Virat Kohli in several Vivo ads clicking selfies through the V21. In case you have not, know that Vivo markets its device heavily, portraying its camera setup as a highlight.\\n\\nIt is easy to see why. The company has equipped the phone with almost every camera feature it could have offered at this price and some more. For the rear, this includes a 64-megapixel primary lens, coupled to a multi-functional 8-megapixel lens for Wide-angle and Bokeh shots and a 2-megapixel macro lens for close-ups.\\n\\nThrough these lenses, the Vivo V21 can click impressive images with optimum clarity and onpoint colours and detailing. The photos turn out well under all lighting conditions. The only struggle you might face is while correcting the focus on the Portrait mode. Not all images are focused on instantly with the right lighting, and you will have to set it yourself for the best results.\\n\\nThe setup also offers OIS or optical image stabilization to help improve blurs caused by camera shake as well as improve photo quality, especially in low-light. This is further complemented by EIS or electronic image stabilization for slower shutter speed and extended exposure time.\\n\\nAll this makes the camera extremely reliable for easy handheld shots. Those looking to shoot videos will also find the V21 handy due to its lightweight.\\n\\nIMAGE SAMPLES\\n\\nInterestingly, the OIS is not restricted to the primary camera at the back of the Vivo V21. The phone was launched as having the world's first 44-megapixel OIS selfie camera, which means that the OIS is present on both the back as well as the front of the device.\\n\\nThis enables several features for those looking to click selfies or making selfie videos like vloggers. This includes Autofocus for distant subjects as well as for the eyes of the people in the image for a more portrait look. Other than this, users can record from the front and back simultaneously through the Vivo V21.\\n\\nSelfies clicked through the V21 are sharp and detailed. They look much less AI-enhanced, as was the case with previous Vivo devices. They also offer rich colours with on-point brightness through optimum light capture. For this, the smartphone also comes with a dual-LED flash at the front.\\n\\nVivo V21 review: Verdict\\n\\nAs can be understood, there is a scope of refinement on the Vivo V21. Display and OS are some of these, with other shortcomings being too marginal to consider. It does score big on the form factor and ease of use for different operations a user performs throughout the day.\\n\\nFor V21, it is more important to mark a spot in its category that cannot be challenged. Considering all it offers is exactly the same as what's on the Vivo V20, this might be really tough for the V21. Then there is competition from the likes of the OnePlus 9R, iQOO 7, Xiaomi Mi 11X.\\n\\nSo what can be said for sure is that at the price of Rs 29,990 for the base variant, the Vivo V21 is an appealing smartphone for those needing an easy and capable smartphone to use.

It now sounds like a distant dream, with a lurking fear that one may become infected and posing a threat to our dear ones. Working from home doesn’t allow us to fully unwind, being in office 24/7.\\n\\nStress is a normal part of life and when experienced in small and intermittent doses helps us beat procrastination, boost productivity and achieve many a great feat!

              " 'There is little to doubt that the Covid-19 Second Wave is now in full force. In this kind of scenario, nearly the entire country is in some kind of lockdown or curfew. The result is that we are restricted to be indoors once again. While we are sure the majority of the time is spent working from home, but what to do after working hours? We are sure that just like us, you too are missing those weekend rides/drives and seeing those lovely machines parked up is nothing short of being painful. But look at it this way; staying home today will ensure you get to ride those machines again. But the question is how do petrol heads deal with such a situation? Here are five things to do which might just pacify those needs.\\n\\nDo not forget about your vehicle. Keep doing periodic checks and make sure that it is ready when you need it.\\n\\nDon’t park and forget\\n\\nYour cars and bikes need attention even when not in use. So it is wise to give them a check once every few days. In case you have a personal garage, things will be easier for you. But if you are a resident of an apartment complex make sure you mask up before stepping into the garage area. Check if the vehicle has been messed around with or not. Has it moved from its place? Are all accessories there? We are all aware of unscrupulous characters who love to pen a scratch on the body work or those who would graciously accept you vehicle cover. So give the vehicle a visual check. Considering all things are alright, start up the vehicle and let it idle. Do not wring the throttle! This will also give you an idea of the battery charge status. If the vehicle is not cranking the battery will need a recharge and having a charger at home is advisable. It is a simple device and available online. The next thing to do is to move the vehicle forward and backward to avoid flat spots on the tyres. Pump up the tyres if they are sagging. While there is no need for a cleanup, doing so is not harmful especially if you have not done so while storing the vehicle. Also make sure that your vehicle is not under siege of rodents.\\n\\nGlance through the engine bay and check for rodent infestation. Also start up your vehicle and let it idle till it reaches optimum temperature. This will also rejuvenate the battery.\\n\\nKeep fit\\n\\nThis is a rather controversial topic to delve in. Keeping fit involves activities which can be done within the confines of your home. We will not recommend going out cycling at the moment and hence some freehand exercises should do wonders. Also keep happy by eating well while keeping calories under check. Always remember that riding a bike or driving a car for long periods demand a good deal of fitness. So stay fit!\\n\\nNow is the time to start planning for that epic road trip. Plan the route, costs, stayovers, distances etc. This will keep you motivated and you will look forward to the good times ahead. It will also help keep mental peace.\\n\\nPlan for your next road trip\\n\\nEach one of us is yearning for those long trips. We all are missing seeing the hills, highways and even missing out our favorite chai shops. Instead of sulking over it, plan for your next grand outing. This is the time when you can make all those calculations on time, distance and even cost. So for example, if riding to Ladakh is your dream, start planning! Get the route in order first and zoom into practical distances for the day. Then list out the things you will need to do to get your motorcycle fighting fit and ready for the trip. Thereafter, calculate costs etc. It is also advisable to get online and chat with friends and groups who have been there and done that. Take their suggestions and this way you will be able to plan better. This will keep you engrossed and the more you see the good things in life, your mental health will improve, and you will conjure up the will to stay indoors for a better time outdoor tomorrow.\\n\\nLearn basic maintenance skills. DIY guides are available online.\\n\\nLearn technical bits about your machines\\n\\nNow is the time to increase your technical knowledge. Start scouring the internet to learn more things about your ride. If you are a biker and planning for a road trip, you should be aware of making road side repairs. Things like how to change a clutch cable, how to bleed the brakes, how to repair a puncture, how to change a headlight bulb are all such topics. Also, it is a good idea to plan for a set of tools which will enable you to carry out these repairs. Over time and many rides we have learnt that these small issues can cause havoc to a rider. So increase your DIY knowledge.\\n\\nGive your riding gear a thorough once over. Replace items if necessary.\\n\\nGet your riding gear rejuvenated\\n\\nConsidering that you are not riding or driving at the moment, get your motoring paraphernalia in order. This mainly concerns our biker friends who wear proper gear including riding jackets, helmets, gloves, shoes etc. cleaning these protective elements demands care and attention. One has to literally dismantle them and outcome the protective elements. The helmet requires special care and cleaning it is a task in itself. So take this opportunity to keep yourself busy and learn the tricks of the trade.\\n\\nIn all keep yourself busy doing things you like to do. Get involved and learn new things. This way you will be able to keep not just physically fit but also mentally strong. Here is to your next big drive or ride.\\n\\nALSO READ | Tips to keep your car’s exterior sanitized during Covid-19 lockdown\\n\\nALSO READ | Tips to keep your car’s interior sanitized during Covid-19 lockdown period',\n",

The lightweight mirrors, coatings, actuators and mechanisms, electronics and thermal blankets when fully deployed form a single precise mirror that is truly remarkable,” said Lee Feinberg, optical telescope element manager for Webb at Nasa\\'s Goddard Space Flight Center.\\n\\nDuring the testing, commands were relayed to the telescope to unlatch and deploy the side panels of the mirror. In a bid to create the zero-gravity environment in which Webb will function, the team attached special gravity offsetting equipment to Webb. However, all of the final thermal blanketing and innovative shielding designed to protect its mirrors and instruments from interference were in place during testing.\\n\\nThe size of the giant telescope had posed a serious transportation challenge for Nasa and therefore scientists used a new foldable design with movable parts that have been specifically made to fold themselves to a compact formation, making the telescope considerably smaller than when it is fully deployed. The new design has made it possible for the telescope to fit inside a 16-foot rocket fairing that will lift it off the ground later this year.\\n\\nAlso Read: Flying on Mars is possible: Here\\'s how small rotorcraft Ingenuity proved it\\n\\n\"To deploy, operate and bring its golden mirrors into focus requires 132 individual actuators and motors in addition to complex backend software to support it.

              " 'Reta Mays has a history of mental health issues, and offered no explanation Tuesday for why she killed the men. (AP)\\n\\nA former nursing assistant who killed seven elderly veterans with fatal injections of insulin at a West Virginia hospital was sentenced to life in prison on Tuesday by a federal judge who called her “the monster that no one sees coming.”\\n\\nReta Mays has a history of mental health issues, and offered no explanation Tuesday for why she killed the men. But U.S. District Judge Thomas Kleeh told her “you knew what you were doing” before sentencing her to seven consecutive life terms, a punishment that means she’ll likely die in prison.\\n\\nMays, 46, pleaded guilty last year in federal court to seven counts of second-degree murder for intentionally injecting the men with unprescribed insulin at the Louis A. Johnson VA Medical Center in Clarksburg.\\n\\nWhile the deaths accumulated during her overnight shifts at the hospital in 2017 and 2018, Mays conducted internet searches on female serial killers and watched the Netflix series “Nurses Who Kill,” Kleeh said. He also said she repeatedly denied her involvement, telling investigators three times that she had no knowledge of the crimes.\\n\\n“Several times your counsels made the point that you shouldn’t be considered a monster,” Kleeh told Mays. “Respectfully, I disagree with that. You are the worst kind. You’re the monster that no one sees coming.”\\n\\nMays cried and apologized in addressing the court briefly before learning her sentence.\\n\\n“I know that there’s no words that I can say that would alter the families’ pain and comfort,” she said. “I don’t ask for forgiveness because I don’t think I could forgive anyone for doing what I did.”\\n\\nHospital officials reported the deaths to the VA inspector general and fired Mays after evidence pointed to her.\\n\\nAn interview with Mays after her guilty plea was included in a lengthy report released after Tuesday’s sentencing by the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Office of Inspector General detailing deficiencies at the hospital.\\n\\nIn it, she said she administered insulin to patients she believed were suffering so they that could pass “gently.” She said she also had great stress and chaos in her personal and professional life, and that her actions gave her a sense of control.\\n\\nBut Assistant U.S. Attorney Jarod Douglas called her actions “predatory and planned, not reactionary.”\\n\\n“These men were not in need of mercy by the defendant,” Douglas said. “In the end it wasn’t the defendant’s call to make.”\\n\\nMays’ attorney, Jay McCamic, described her long history of depression, anxiety, mental health and other medical issues, including a trip to the emergency room when a patient knocked her unconscious with a punch to the face in May 2016.\\n\\n“Many, many people ask why, why did Reta do this?” McCamic said. “Most people want to have a nice, linear story applied to the conspiracy, a unified motive of why someone would set upon the idea of taking the life of others and go forth with that idea. Unfortunately, why is not a question that can be answered here. Reta doesn’t know why. Her family doesn’t know why.”\\n\\nMays, of Reynoldsville, had served in the Army National Guard in a noncombat position in Iraq and Afghanistan.\\n\\nHer duties at the hospital included measuring patients’ vital signs and blood glucose levels. VA nursing assistants are not qualified or authorized to administer medication, including insulin, prosecutors said. The hospital’s nursing assistants also were not required to have a certificate or license as a condition of continuing employment.\\n\\nThen-U.S. Attorney Bill Powell said there were about 20 suspicious deaths at the medical center during the time Mays worked there, but charges were only brought in cases where the government thought it had sufficient evidence.\\n\\nThe second-degree murder charges involved the deaths of Army veterans Robert Lee Kozul Sr., 89, Archie D. Edgell, 84, Felix Kirk McDermott, 82, and William Holloway, 96; Navy veteran Robert Edge Sr., 82; Air Force veteran George Nelson Shaw Sr., 81; and Army and Air Force veteran Raymond Golden, 88.\\n\\nShe also was sentenced to an additional 20 years for assault with intent to commit murder involving the death of Navy veteran Russell R. Posey Sr., 92.\\n\\nSeparately, the federal government has agreed to the settlement of numerous lawsuits filed by veterans’ families alleging a widespread system of failures at the hospital.\\n\\nThe VA is responsible for 9 million military veterans. The agency’s former director was fired in 2018 in the wake of a bruising ethics scandal and a mounting rebellion within the agency. Robert Wilkie took over as Veterans Affairs secretary in July 2018.\\n\\nAlso Read | At least 11 killed in school shooting in Russia, several injured\\n\\nAlso Read | Indian-origin man charged with killing, sexually abusing his 65-year-old mother in New York',\n",
              " 'The recent two-year decline in birth rates in Xinjiang is far larger than that of China over the entire 36-year length of the ‘one child’ policy, under which Han Chinese were subject to stricter birth restrictions. (Photo: AP)\\n\\nXinjiang in far western China had the sharpest known decline in birthrates between 2017 and 2019 of any territory in recent history, according to a new analysis by an Australian think tank.\\n\\nThe report from the Australian Strategy Policy Institute obtained exclusively ahead of publication by The Associated Press, showed the 48.74% decline was concentrated in areas with many Uighurs, Kazakhs and other largely Muslim ethnic minorities, based on the Chinese government statistics over nearly a decade.\\n\\nBirth rates in largely minority counties fell 43.7% between 2017 and 2018 alone, with over 160,000 fewer babies born. That compares to a slight increase in births in counties populated mostly by China’s Han majority.\\n\\nSuch an extreme drop in birthrates is unprecedented in the 71 years since the United Nations began collecting global fertility statistics, beating out even declines during the Syrian civil war and the genocides in Rwanda and Cambodia, said Nathan Ruser, an ASPI researcher and co-author of the report.\\n\\n“As far as it’s possible to find out, it is by far the largest drop there is,” Ruser said. “It makes you realize the scale of these family planning policies and the scale of this crackdown, the scale of societal control that authorities are looking for.”\\n\\nThe ASPI report corroborates an AP story and a report by German researcher Adrian Zenz last year that found the Chinese government was systemically slashing Uighurbirthrates with sterilizations, abortions and intrauterine devices, and fining and detaining people with three or more children.\\n\\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry and the Xinjiang government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, Zenz and ASPI have come under increasing attack from Beijing, which points to their funding from the governments of the US and other Western countries to discredit them. The AP confirmed many of the figures were based on Chinese government statistics.\\n\\nOver the past four years, the Chinese authorities have carried out a brutal campaign of forced assimilation targeting the Uighurs, an ethnic Turkic minority native to Xinjiang. Officials cracked down after a series of bombings and knife attacks by separatist Uighurs, sweeping a million or more people into a network of newly built camps and prisons. The crackdown has triggered sanctions from the West, and on Wednesday a group of Western countries are slated to hold a UN event on China’s repression of the Uighurs.\\n\\nEysa Imin, an Uighurfrom Korla in the centre of Xinjiang, recalled eight people in his neighbourhood detained for having too many children. When he himself was thrown in a detention centre in 2017, he ended up sharing a cell with an old schoolmate who had been arrested, tortured and interrogated for having four children.\\n\\n“When they arrested him, they said it was a sign of extremism,” Imin said. “The government started connecting having many children with Islamic extremism. ... It feels like they want to eliminate us.”\\n\\nExperts note that the tightening of birth control measures must be understood in the broader context of fear that’s pervasive among Xinjiang’s minorities.\\n\\n“Just for self-survival, you’re going to publicly complain, for fear that you or your family might be detained,” said Timothy Grose, a professor specializing in Xinjiang at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Indiana. “Any sign of resistance could get you sent to reeducation.”\\n\\nPhoto: AP\\n\\nFor decades, China had one of the most extensive systems of minority preferential treatment in the world, including hiring quotas and extra points on college entrance exams. The government also allowed ethnic minorities two or three children, even as it restricted its Han majority to just one child.\\n\\nSuch benefits have been rolled back and even reversed under President Xi Jinping, China’s most authoritarian leader in decades. State-backed scholars began calling on the government to crack down on large religious minority families, calling them breeding grounds for terrorism and extremism. In April 2017, Xinjiang’s top official called for the “effective containment of illegal births” specifically in southern Xinjiang, where most Uighurs live.\\n\\nIn the eyes of Chinese officials, the current measures taken are simply “correcting” lax birth controls for minorities. The government has repeatedly said that abortions, sterilizations and IUD insertions in Xinjiang are voluntary, and on paper, both Han Chinese and Uighurs can have two children.\\n\\nHowever, in practice, minorities appear to be singled out and targeted for especially draconian birth control measures, the report said. Birth rates in heavily minority counties fell by nearly two thirds since the new measures were implemented, the analysis shows, while Han Chinese counties saw much milder declines in line with the rest of China. Han-majority districts in Xinjiang’s capital, Urumqi, even saw booming birthrates.\\n\\nThe recent two-year decline in birth rates in Xinjiang is far larger than that of China over the entire 36-year length of the ‘one child’ policy, under which Han Chinese were subject to stricter birth restrictions, Ruser noted. ASPI also unearthed government notices showing that Xinjiang officials are being given quotas to lower birth rates, with punishments meted out to those who failed to meet family planning targets. A target set in one heavily Uighur county is lower than the birthrate of South Korea, the lowest in the world.\\n\\nThe crackdown comes even as Chinese officials mull lifting restrictions on births nationwide. On Tuesday, officials announced that China’s population has barely grown over the past decade, fueling fears that the country faces a “demographic time bomb.”\\n\\nThe report also found that about half of Xinjiang’s 106 county-level administrative units have not published birthrate figures for 2019, though they should have been published last year.\\n\\n“These statistics have become politically problematic,” Ruser said. “It’s easier to simply not publish the data.”',\n",

He is a unique type of bowler, it is very difficult to pick him.\\n\\n\"Along with that he has the pace, he bowls good short deliveries and because of that slowly and steadily Jasprit Bumrah\\'s dominance in international cricket is going on increasing,\" former national selector Karim said.\\n\\nIndia last week named its 20-member Test squad for the WTC final and the subsequent five-match series against England. Virat Kohli\\'s Team India is scheduled to take on Kane Williamson\\'s side in the WTC final at the Rose Bowl in Southampton from June 18.\\n\\nThe Test series against hosts England will take place in Nottingham, London, Leeds and Manchester from August 4.',\n",
              " \"On this day in 2019, Lasith Malinga defended 9 runs in the final over to help MI beat CSK in IPL final (Courtesy of BCCI)\\n\\nMumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings have had several memorable encounters in the Indian Premier League. When the two teams met in IPL 2021 before it was suspended due to Covid-19 crisis, there were fireworks in Delhi as Kieron Pollard came up with a special knock to help Mumbai complete their highest successful chase.\\n\\nThere have been many such thrillers but it's hard to top the IPL 2019 final when talking about close encounters between the two champion sides. On May 12, 2019, CSK and MI went against each other to prove their might at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad.\\n\\nThe stage was perfectly set up as Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings were battling to become the first team in IPL history to win 2 titles. CSK were the then-defending champions and MS Dhoni's side were looking to win back-to-back IPL titles for the 2nd time in the history of the league.\\n\\nLasith Malinga and Kieron Pollard made sure Mumbai Indians went ahead and won their 4th title, leaving Chennai Super Kings heartbroken. By the barest of margins, Rohit Sharma's men sealed the final and lifted the trophy in Hyderabad.\\n\\nRohit Sharma won the toss and Mumbai Indians opted to bat. As expected, Mumbai got off to a fine start with Rohit (15) and Quinton de Kock (29) adding 45 runs for the opening wicket. However, Shardul Thakur and Deepak Chahar struck in quick succession to send back the two Mumbai openers.\\n\\nImran Tahir, who won he Purple Cap in 2019, struck major blows in the middle overs, removing Suryakumar Yadav (15) and Ishan Kishan (23) to peg back Mumbai. Krunal Pandya, who was promoted ahead of Kieron Pollard and Hardik Pmnayda, failed to trouble the scorers much as he departed for 7.\\n\\nHardik Pandya chipped in with 16 but Mumbai lost wickets in a hurry in the end overs. However, Pollard held his ground and made sure Mumbai posted a par total of 149. The West Indies star hit 3 sixes and as many boundaries for his 25-ball 41 not out.\\n\\nShane Watson 80 not enough for CSK\\n\\nIn reply, Faf du Plessis took charge and attacked the Mumbai Indians bowlers in the powerplay while Shane Watson, who had been in middling form, struggled to get going.\\n\\nHowever, Krunal Pandya struck to remove Faf du Plessis in the 4th over for a 13-ball 26. It was a crucial blow as du Plessis was looking to run away with the game.\\n\\nCSK then crumbled! Suresh Raina (8) and Ambati Rayudu (1) fell in quick succesion.\\n\\nMS Dhoni was run-out for 2 after he tried to steal an extra run of an overthrow.\\n\\nCSK were reeling at 82 for 4 in the 13th over before Dwayne Bravo and Watson added 51 runs in quick time for the 6th wicket.\\n\\nWatson, who was struggling to get going, tore into Mumbai Indians bowling attack in the end overs, making sure the asking rate wasn't an issue for CSK.\\n\\nThe Malinga masterstroke from Rohit\\n\\nWatson was batting in the 70s and CSK needed just 9 runs from the last over.\\n\\nRohit had a problem as his strike bowler Lasith Malinga had conceded 41 runs in 3 overs after being taken apart by Watson. However, the MI captain trusted his senior bowler and gave him the final over.\\n\\nMalinga delivered! After Shane Watson was run out in the 4th ball of the over on 80, it all came down to the last ball.\\n\\nShardul Thakur was the batsman. Malinga ran in with CSK needing 2 for win. Malinga came up with a yorker that hit the shoe of Thakur. He appealed and the finger was raised. CSK lost the final by a run.\",\n",
              " 'The Mi 11X Pro is supposed to be Xiaomi’s new flagship killer in India. It is re-branded Redmi K40 Pro but, offers flagship Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor in the Indian at a very aggressive price point of around Rs 40,000. The phone was launched alongside the Mi 11X and Mi 11 Ultra in the last week of April. We have reviewed all three phones on India Today Tech and you can find links to each of them at the end of this story.\\n\\nComing back to Mi 11X Pro, it has been launched in two variants and both come with 8GB of LPDDR5 RAM paired with two storage options. The 128GB storage variant is priced at Rs 39,999 and the 256GB storage variant costs Rs 41,999. For the extra Rs 10,000 you spend as compared to the Mi 11X, you also get an improved 108-megapixel main camera which makes a lot of difference.\\n\\nSo, if you have been planning to buy Mi 11X Pro, here is a quick look at everything you need to know and should consider.\\n\\nPoint 1 The Mi 11X Pro is a beautiful phone. It has exactly the same design and form factor as the Mi 11X but, the colour variant I got for review this time, is gorgeous. The phone was launched in Cosmic Black, Lunar White, and Celestial Silver colours. I have been using the last and it reminded me of the Vivo V20 Pro. The rear panel changes colours as light falls on it from different directions. The variant certainly looks better than the black variant of the Mi 11X I had for review and also attracts less fingerprint smudges.\\n\\nXiaomi has also done a good job of keeping this phone compact and light. The phone is only 7.8mm thick and weighs 196 grams. It makes the Mi 11X Pro comfortable to hold and use.\\n\\nPoint 2 The display on the Mi 11X Pro ticks all brackets for the price. It uses an AMOLED panel, has good brightness and high refresh rate. In terms of numbers, you get a 6.67-inch FHD+ Super AMOLED display with 120Hz refresh rate and up to 360Hz touch sampling rate. The display supports HDR 10+, MEMC technology and is one of the better panels you can find on an affordable premium smartphone. It is bright, smooth and vibrant. The sharpness could have been better but is passable.\\n\\nPoint 3 The Mi 11X Pro gives a reliable performance. It is one of the most affordable smartphones in the country to come with Snapdragon 888 processor. The Mi 11X Pro costs almost Rs 8,000 less than the OnePlus 9 which uses the same chipset and that’s an achievement for Xiaomi, especially in the times when there is a global chip shortage. It should also receive MIUI 12.5 update soon, improving the overall user experience.\\n\\nHowever, there is one thing you need to keep in mind. The Mi 11X Pro doesn’t come with a microSD card slot. This means that the storage on phone cannot be expected. So, I will advise you to opt for the 256GB storage variant as the price difference is only Rs 2,000.\\n\\nPoint 4 One of the reasons why you should skip the Mi 11X and spend on the Mi 11X Pro instead is its camera performance. The phone comes with a 108-megapixel main shooter on the Mi 11X Pro which is a considerable improvement compared to the 48-megapixel one on the Mi 11X. The main camera is assisted by an 8-megapixel ultrawide unit with an f/2.2 aperture, and a 5-megapixel telemacro camera with an f/2.4 aperture.\\n\\nThe main camera does a great job across light conditions. The images are sharp in both daylight and at night. Yes, the night shots have lesser details but that is only noticeable if you zoom in to the pictures. The details further drop off on the ultrawide camera but, that’s the case with most smartphones. The field of view here is impressive. Most colours are also retained but, sharpness goes for a toss.\\n\\nOn the front, the Mi 11X Pro features a 20-megapixel selfie camera with an f/2.45 aperture. The selfies come out fine in daylight but, are on the softer side in the night.\\n\\nPoint 5 I wasn’t particularly impressed by the battery on the Mi 11X Pro. It’s not the size. The phone comes with a 4520 mAh battery which is standard on most premium phones, including the OnePlus 9. However, the battery drains fast. There were days when I had to plug in the phone before the end of the day. Xiaomi also ships the Mi 11X Pro with a 33W fast charger which it is using for most phones in India. It could have differentiated the premium offering using a faster charger.\\n\\nOverall, the Mi 11X Pro is a good phone for the price. It has a good display, a capable camera system, the best processor and a very pretty colour option. It is slim, stylish and offers extremely good value for money. The OnePlus 9, on the other hand, offers a cleaner software experience and faster charging for a few more bucks.',\n",
              " 'Dogecoin has been in the spotlight lately, largely thanks to Elon Musk and his owned enterprises. Days after the tech billionaire\\'s aerospace firm SpaceX announced the use of Dogecoin to pay for a lunar satellite, Musk has now hinted at its potential use of buying a Tesla.\\n\\nTaking to Twitter, Musk asked his followers if they would like to pay for a Tesla with Dogecoins. For those unaware, Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that originated as a meme or a joke for the seriousness of the cryptocurrency industry. Based on a Japanese dog breed named Shiba Inu, it was created to build a vibrant community in the cryptocurrency world.\\n\\nElon Musk is a long time admirer of Dogecoin and has established himself as a very important part of this community. On Tuesday, Musk tweeted, \"Do you want Tesla to accept Doge?\" in the form of a Twitter poll.\\n\\nAmong the Yes or No options, more than 78 per cent of respondents have recorded Yes as the answer. If the Tesla CEO follows the public verdict and the example of his other firm\\'s recent Dogecoin investment, there is a chance that you might just be able to buy a Tesla with Dogecoin soon.\\n\\nWhat does this mean?\\n\\nDogecoin has been on a rollercoaster in the markets for the past month. It experienced hype with the announcement of Elon Musk\\'s Saturday Night Live appearance on May 8. Musk had let his Twitter followers know that he would mention the cryptocurrency at the show. He did, but it did not have the effect many around the globe were expecting.\\n\\nFrom reaching record heights in anticipation, the crypto crashed in the markets, making many lose their money right at the time of Musk\\'s SNL performance. Not that Musk didn\\'t do his part. He called the cryptocurrency a \"hustle\" and a \"stimulus for people kicked by pandemic.\"\\n\\nDogecoin lost more than 30 per cent of its value within hours. Since then, it has seen short spikes, one majorly due to the SpaceX announcement a couple of days back. One of the top aerospace manufacturers in the world announced that it would send DOGE-1, a lunar satellite named after Dogecoin, to the moon in the first quarter of next year. The company has taken Dogecoin as payment for the mission.\\n\\nWith the possibility of Tesla following this lead, what exactly does it mean for you? If Tesla says it will accept payments in Dogecoin, you will have to transfer the number of Dogecoins equivalent to the price of the car, as per the market value of the cryptocurrency at that time.\\n\\nThe operational sense of it can be guessed with Tesla\\'s current acceptance of Bitcoins for Tesla. The US electric vehicle firm allows buyers to directly transfer Bitcoin from their crypto wallets to Tesla\\'s account. The amount of Bitcoin depends on its current market value, and hence a transaction should be executed within a short time period.\\n\\nWe can expect the same with Dogecoin, that is if Tesla ultimately allows Dogecoin payments. The cryptocurrency, however, has a negligible market value in comparison to others like Bitcoin. Hence, it might be a hefty amount of Dogecoin one has to pay for Tesla.\\n\\nOf course, that will depend on the crypto\\'s prevailing performance in the market. It is bound to rise multifold in value if Tesla gives the green light to Dogecoin payments. So if you have a Dogecoin today and it doubles by the time such payments are accepted, you will effectively be buying a Tesla at half its price. Though don\\'t consider it as financial advice, just a mere observation.',\n",
              " \"Battlegrounds Mobile is yet to arrive in India but the mobile gaming market in India seems to be already heating up because of that. Activision may now be planning to bring Call of Duty Warzone to smartphones after its smash mobile title Call of Duty Mobile. The developer has posted a job advertisement on LinkedIn inviting applications from candidates who will focus on “content expansion across Call of Duty.” The Call of Duty Warzone is among the leading games with battle royale strategy for gaming consoles, such as Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5, and Windows. Its smartphone version is likely to take on PUBG Mobile’s upcoming Indian version, as well as PUBG: New State.\\n\\nThe LinkedIn post does not directly mention Activision’s plans for the Call of Duty Warzone, but one of the hashtags from the post gives it away. “Our dev teams are dedicated to mobile and comprised of all major disciplines. We're hire globally, and in addition to Art and Production we've opened new roles for Engineering (Graphics & C++) and Designers (Game/System),” reads the job advertisement. There is a link to the job vacancy directory that currently has over 91 job profiles, including those for graphics engineer and build engineer for mobile.\\n\\nIf Activision is actually planning to introduce Warzone to smartphones, it is likely the two Call of Duty versions will coexist. Since the Call of Duty Mobile game seems far from over, with new tournaments and seasons emerging frequently for players. And in the case of this event, it will be interesting to see how Activision manages to make the two Call of Duty games differ from each other, despite being based on battle royale strategy.\\n\\nRight now, the specifics around the mobile version of Call of Duty Warzone are not clear. However, there is speculation that Activision is gearing up to give a tough fight to Krafton as the latter is set to launch its second battle royale game called PUBG: New State sometime later this year. PUBG: New State is set in the year 2051 where anarchy rules, and since we are talking about a post-apocalyptic world for the next game, there will be futuristic weapons and vehicles, including drones in the game. Activision’s Call of Duty Warfare is already out for a good fraction of gamers, which means it is not new like PUBG: New State. And that is where the mystery lies. The mystery is that the mobile version of Call of Duty Warfare may come with new maps, new weapons, and new vehicles.\",\n",

              " \"Theatre as a profession in India: All you need to know\\n\\nIndian theater was on the rise and yes it was flourishing, till the time covid knocked on the casting director’s door and asked for a role. Even though these are uncertain times and have impacted the industry badly, am optimistic that we will be back on stage soon. In this article! Here are common questions which theater enthusiasts have been ask all the time! Hope my responses will benefit you.\\n\\nTheatre as a profession in India: All you need to know\\n\\nQ1. “I am not from Mumbai, Bangalore or Delhi but a Tier II city, how can I do theater?”\\n\\nIf you have an auditorium in your city, chances are that plays are being staged there. You would want to visit these places or call and inquire. Also, don’t underestimate the power of internet. Use your social media platforms to find theater groups or people who are into theater from your city. In today’s intimate world, you are bound to find a connection.\\n\\nQ2. “How can I join a theater group?”\\n\\nOnce you figure out the theater groups in your city, there are many ways you can reach out to them. Unfortunately till today, there is no structured way or a process which theater groups follow to recruit new talent. But you may try the following:\\n\\nIf they are putting up a play in your city try to watch the play\\n\\nTry to meet the team after the performance and express your willingness to be a part of them, they will guide you accordingly\\n\\nIf you know someone already or have a reference, it will be easy for you to meet up with people\\n\\nAmidst this pandemic, use the internet to find about the theatre groups across the country and try to reach out to them via social media platforms. Many groups are hosting virtual plays and workshops. You might want to participate and broaden your network.\\n\\nQ3. “Can I take up theater as a full time profession?”\\n\\nThe answer to this is yes as well as no. Unfortunately as an actor, theater does not pay much in India, but I can say with élan that it’s the best school for any actor to learn the basics. After mastering the craft and building credibility, one can also move to academics which might be a fruitful option considering financial stability. Very often theater actors take up acting assignments in films and web series to pay their bills, which might be a way going forward.\\n\\nQ4. “What are the opportunities for theater actors in India?”\\n\\nIn my opinion, this is the best time in India to be a theater actor. Check out the cast of all the prominent web series on Indian OTT platforms, almost all are from the stage. Casting directors today are heavily relying on theater to fulfill their talent pipeline. They usually look out for theater actors who are considered to be more ‘real’ and ‘raw’ and suit the realistic and humane OTT stories well.\\n\\nQ5. “How is theater acting different from film acting?”\\n\\nEven though the basics of acting remain the same, film acting is very different from acting on stage. Theater actors might have to adapt to camera acting, and it might not be too easy but still manageable. On the other hand a film actor might have to work extra hard to manage a transition to stage. No doubt, getting trained in theater is better than they always keep you grounded with the basics.\\n\\nQ6. “I wish to do professional theater; do I need to go to Mumbai?”\\n\\nUnfortunately, if you are looking for some professional theater experience, you have no option but to work with some prominent theater companies in a Mumbai, Delhi or Bangalore. These cities are known for churning out some of the best English plays in the country.\\n\\nA closing advice, use the lockdown effectively. Read a lot of plays also learn and perform monologues, you may even want to record them and share on right platforms.\\n\\nThe show must go on!\\n\\nRead more| Here's how you can build your career in online e-commerce market\",\n",

              " 'The Gaza Health Ministry says the death toll from Israeli airstrikes on Gaza has climbed to 43, including 13 children and three women.\\n\\nIt says nearly 300 Palestinians in the territory have been wounded in the strikes, which began Monday as Palestinians launched a barrage of rockets into Israel.\\n\\nThe worst fighting since the 2014 Gaza war was ignited by clashes in Jerusalem in recent weeks between Palestinian protesters and Israeli police focused on the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, a site sacred to Jews and Muslims.\\n\\nHAMAS LOBS HUNDREDS OF ROCKETS IN 24 HOURS, ISRAEL RESPONDS BY ATTACKING TARGETS IN GAZA\\n\\nRockets streamed out of Gaza and Israel pounded the territory with airstrikes early Wednesday as the most severe outbreak of violence since the 2014 war took on many hallmarks of that devastating 50-day conflict, with no endgame in sight.\\n\\nGaza\\'s Hamas rulers and other militant groups have fired barrages of hundreds of rockets that at times have overwhelmed Israel\\'s missile defenses, causing air raid sirens and explosions to echo across Tel Aviv, Israel\\'s biggest metropolitan area, and other cities.\\n\\nIsraeli airstrikes have leveled two apartment towers in the Gaza Strip, where 2 million Palestinians have lived under a crippling Israeli-Egyptian blockade since Hamas took power in 2007. Warning shots have allowed civilians to evacuate the buildings, but the material losses will be immense. Israel faced heavy criticism over the tactic during the 2014 war.\\n\\nJust after daybreak Wednesday, Israel unleashed dozens of airstrikes in the course of a few minutes, targeting police and security installations, witnesses said. A wall of dark gray smoke rose over Gaza City. The Hamas-run Interior Ministry said airstrikes destroyed the central police headquarters in Gaza City, a compound with several buildings.\\n\\nThe death toll in Gaza rose to 35 Palestinians, including 12 children and three women, according to the Health Ministry. Some 233 people were wounded. Five Israelis, including three women and a child, were killed by rocket fire Tuesday and early Wednesday, and dozens of people were wounded.\\n\\nThe Israeli military said militants have fired more than 1,050 rockets since the conflict began, with 200 of them falling short and landing inside Gaza. The military said it also shot down a drone that entered Israel from Gaza. Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman, said two infantry brigades were sent to the area, indicating preparations for a possible ground invasion.\\n\\nSamah Haboub, a mother of four in Gaza, said she was thrown across her bedroom in a \"moment of horror\" by an airstrike on an apartment tower next door. She and her children, aged 3 to 14, ran down the stairway of their apartment block along with other residents, many of them screaming and crying.\\n\\n\"There is almost no safe place in Gaza,\" she said.\\n\\nThe destruction of apartment towers was among several tactics used during the 2014 war that are now the subject of an investigation by the International Criminal Court into possible war crimes. Israel is not a member of the court and has rejected the probe.\\n\\nIn a brief statement, ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said she had noted, \"with great concern\" the escalation of violence in the region and \"the possible commission of crimes under the Rome Statute\" that established the court.\\n\\nConricus said Israeli forces have strict rules of engagement and follow international laws on armed conflict. \"We are definitely very mindful of civilian casualties in Gaza and we want to minimize them,\" he said. \"That’s the priority.\"\\n\\nThe latest eruption of violence began a month ago in Jerusalem, where heavy-handed police tactics during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the threatened eviction of dozens of Palestinian families by Jewish settlers ignited protests and clashes with police. A focal point was the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, a site sacred to Jews and Muslims.\\n\\nIsrael and Hamas have fought three wars since the Islamic militant group seized power in Gaza from rival Palestinian forces in 2007. The conflicts ended after regional and international powers convinced both sides to accept an informal truce.\\n\\nWhile the violence has been widely condemned, there is no sign that either side is willing to back down. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to expand the offensive, saying \"this will take time.\"\\n\\nStill, diplomats are seeking to intervene, with Qatar, Egypt, and the United Nations working to deliver a cease-fire.\\n\\nThe U.N. Security Council also planned to hold its second closed emergency meeting in three days Wednesday on the escalating violence.

Then the backlash from users began.\\n\\nUsers, in particular, objected to one thing: the high-handed way in which WhatsApp forced users to accept the new privacy policy. It said that users have to accept the policy or else they will lose access to the app and they will no longer be allowed to use WhatsApp.\\n\\nFacebook and WhatsApp, on their part, explained that the new privacy policy was necessary because WhatsApp had to share some info with Facebook to implement the e-commerce features in the app. It was also necessary for the app to make the business accounts function better. The company said that it was all for the benefit of users. It argued that the changes in data sharing with Facebook enabled by the new privacy policy ONLY concerned the business accounts and the chats users would do with such accounts.\\n\\nHowever, most users were not convinced. They saw that WhatsApp was going to share more data with Facebook and that spooked them. They also did not like the fact that WhatsApp was telling them to accept the policy or else lose access to the app.\\n\\nSo, a stalemate was reached. WhatsApp pushed the deadline for the new privacy policy to May 15. It also promised to do a better job examining its privacy policy for users.\\n\\nNow the May 15 deadline is approaching. Unlike last time, this time WhatsApp has changed the tactics. It now says that no one will lose access to the app if they don\\'t accept the new privacy. Instead, they will only lose access to some — IMPORTANT — features.\\n\\nIn a way, it is more or less the same thing. The objective of WhatsApp remains the same, and it knows that by reducing features it is essentially forcing users to accept the new privacy policy. In other words, it looks like blackmailing.\\n\\nAnd it seems more like that, because if people can use the same features now when they haven\\'t accepted the new privacy policy, that means the limit that WhatsApp is going to put into the app after May 15 is artificial.\\n\\nFeatures that won\\'t work after May 15\\n\\nWhatsApp recently published an FAQ page acknowledging what happens on May 15 to users who do not accept the new terms and privacy policy. \"No one will have their accounts deleted or lose functionality of WhatsApp on May 15 because of this update,\" the first line on the FAQ page reads.\\n\\nWhatsApp adds that users still have time to accept the updates after May 15. What that means is the messaging platform will keep showing a persistent reminder on the app, and soon after, users will see limited functionality until the user accepts new terms.\\n\\nTalking about limited functionality, the WhatsApp FAQ page adds that users won\\'t be able to access their chat list but can answer incoming voice and video calls till some time. A persistent reminder will show every time users who haven\\'t accepted the new policy will open WhatsApp. The company, however, points out that users who have notifications enabled can tap on them to read or respond to a message or call back a missed phone or video call.\\n\\n\"After a few weeks of limited functionality, you won\\'t be able to receive incoming calls or notifications, and WhatsApp will stop sending messages and calls to your phone,\" the company adds.\\n\\nEssentially, while you retain your WhatsApp account, if you don\\'t accept the new privacy policy, you will not be able to do much with the app. In other words, it is again the same message from WhatsApp: Accept our policy or go use something else.\\n\\nThis is problematic. For two reasons. One, even though WhatsApp argues that its new policy is all about business accounts, when users are not accepting the new policy, they are losing access to not just business chats and business account features in the app but also to personal chats etc.\\n\\nIf WhatsApp really has the convenience of users in mind, why can\\'t it let people who use WhatsApp strictly for personal communication continue with the older privacy policy? It can easily do that and say to users that hey if you want to access business chats and e-commerce features, accept the new privacy policy. Or else, you will be able to use the app only for private communication. But that is not what WhatsApp is saying.\\n\\nAnd two, the new privacy policy is not applicable to users in a number of other countries where privacy laws are strong, and governments often safeguard the interests of users. For example, the new privacy policy isn\\'t being implemented everywhere as Europe has already been exempted from the new rules.\\n\\nOf course, it needs to be said that WhatsApp is a private service. It owes no obligation to users, except the ones specified by law. But it is also a service that is used by over a billion people across the world. So, it is not just another app. It is part of life, and hence everything that it does is going to come under public scrutiny that smaller apps may avoid or get away with.\\n\\nJust like how it played out earlier in 2021, the story of the new privacy policy from WhatsApp is again unfolding in a similar way. In other words, once again, WhatsApp is forcing users to accept the new privacy policy, and this time it is doing so by blackmailing users by threatening to withhold key features from them if they don\\'t say yes to its demands.',\n",

Pero después Saúl salió con todo y fue de un ‘uppercut’, un golpe que lo practicó con Eddy (Reynoso) durante meses”, manifestó el cruceño.\\n\\n“Saúl no tiende a ver las peleas de los oponentes, Eddy sí, entonces él veía mucho que Billy Joe Saunders se agachaba bastante en sus peleas y lo estudio muy bien y por eso uso el ‘uppercut’ para ganar”, agregó.\\n\\nMunir Somoya tiene 36 años y hace 16 que radica en México, donde conoció al ‘Canelo’ Álvarez, con quien trabaja desde hace tres años. Luego se sumó al equipo Andy Ruiz, que también fue campeón mundial, en la categoría de peso pesado.\\n\\nA principios de mayo Ruiz peleó fre\\ufeffnte al mexicano Chris Arreola al que derrotó dando un paso importante en la búsqueda de recuperar el título mundial, que perdió en 2019 ante el británico Anthony Joshua.\\n\\nTrabajar con esas estrellas del boxeo mundial llenan de satisfacción a Munir Somoya, quien, además de aportarles lo que sabe, también considera que sigue aprendiendo sobre todo del entrenador Eddy Reynoso.\\n\\n“Para mi es una satisfacción estar con los campeones del mundo y la verdad que es un trabajo muy profesional, cada día aprendo más sobre todo de Eddy Reynoso. El conocimiento que tiene es grande, se puede poner a dialogar de boxeo con los mejores del mundo y la verdad que tiene mucho conocimiento, entonces yo me apego mucho de él y aprendo mucho de él”, se sinceró.\\n\\nLuego de la pelea del ‘Canelo’ todo el equipo tiene una vacación de 20 días como es habitual luego de concentrar durante varios meses para una pelea por el título mundial, pero en el caso del boliviano regresará al trabajo arduo el 24 de este mes, fecha en la que Andy Ruiz tiene previsto retomar los entrenamientos.',\n",

Pero desde el comienzo de la historia de la Humanidad, los imperios se abrogaron ese desafío: los fenicios, los chinos, los persas, los romanos, los ingleses, los franceses, los americanos, los rusos, y la lista continúa, se fijaron como desafío dominar o influir en el mundo.\\n\\n\\n\\nPero, hagamos un corte. Después de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, dos visiones políticas e ideológicas dividieron la construcción de sociedades, de políticas autoritarias o democráticas y economías liberales o socialistas. La cultura, en todas sus expresiones, construía modelos a seguir bajo enfoques propagandísticos marcados al extremo. La música, el cine, los dibujos animados y la visión apocalíptica dependían de dos botones: uno en la ex Unión Soviética y el otro en los Estados Unidos. El hombre llegaba a la Luna.\\n\\nEran dos ejes, divididos por una cortina de hierro (Churchill). El mundo se había partido en dos. Bastaba, por ejemplo, presenciar los Juego Olímpicos de aquellos años para sentir en la piel esa división cultural in extremis entre el occidente y los países comunistas. Pero luego, con la caída del sistema soviético y su ideología estatista totalitaria, el neoliberalismo se planta como triunfante y todo el mundo vira -casi con desenfreno- hacia la apertura de mercados y el consumismo. Fukuyama anunció el fin de la historia, al quedar omnipresente en el mundo entero un solo modelo económico, social y político: el comunismo había caído en desgracia. Los pueblos subyugados se rebelaron y tiranos como Ceaucescu en Rumania fueron fusilados y derrocados; Yugoslavia desapareció tras la Guerra de los Balcanes y comenzaron los remezones como la Primavera Árabe, entre otras revoluciones sociales, en busca de un cambio más justo, que nunca llegaría.\\n\\nCon el paso del tiempo, el propio modelo capitalista se hundiría en sus propias fauces. El sistema presentó evidentes fallas sociales, las desigualdades económicas se agravaron, el reventón de la burbuja inmobiliaria generó la segunda gran crisis mundial de la economía abierta (después de los años 30) y, cual naipes, las economías liberales tropezaron y las sociedades se convulsionaron exigiendo mejores oportunidades económicas, trabajos decentes, mayores derechos laborales: apareció el populismo o socialismo del siglo XXI. Un parche discursivo de gobiernos profundamente corruptos que debilitaron las democracias.\\n\\nEn este escenario desdibujado, ¿quién es nuestro demiurgo? No hay nadie en el puente de mando de la humanidad: Estados Unidos se fue y China no termina de llegar, y mucho menos de convencer. El filósofo español Ortega y Gasset, ya en su época, meridianamente nos leía que como sociedades no sabemos lo que nos pasa y, eso es, precisamente, lo que nos pasa. Su reflexión apuntaba a sostener que nos encontramos en “un punto de inflexión histórico e incluso incivilatario”.\\n\\nLa gran recesión de 2008 y la pandemia reforzaron la asimetría del crecimiento y China recuperó terreno superando al Occidente. Ya en 2014 la revista Financial Times auspiciaba que así como la economía norteamericana había iniciado su hegemonía en la década de los 80 y 90; en 2014, China comenzaba la suya y la UE iniciaba su retroceso. Ya se discute, incluso, si seguirá unida.\\n\\nTenemos en frente a una superpotencia declinante (EEUU), una potencia ascendente alternativa (China), una potencia sobrevalorada (Rusia) y una potencia ascendente infravalorada (India). Por lo tanto, no habría una hegemonía o un liderazgo claro dominante que se haya encargado del timonel del mundo. De una gobernanza mundial hemos pasado a una multipolaridad asimétrica con políticos fuertes pero con instituciones débiles. Un verdadero caos.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

              " 'Escucha esta nota aquí\\n\\nSegún el último informe Tecnolatinas realizado por la consultora Surfing Tsunamis con el BID-Lab, las empresas tecnológicas nacidas en América Latina se han multiplicado en tamaño y representan un poderoso motor para acelerar el crecimiento y la transformación en la región.\\n\\n“De ellas, 1.005 ya levantaron más de $us 1 millón y valen más de $us 5 millones. En conjunto, hoy valen $us 221.000 millones, generaron casi un cuarto de millón de empleos directos y fuentes de ingreso para otros cientos de miles de personas”, menciona el reporte, citado en América Economía.\\n\\nEl informe también refleja que el valor del ecosistema se multiplicó más de 30 veces en la última década, pasando de $us 7.000 millones a los $us 221.000 millones, mientras que las empresas tradicionales vieron su valor caer en $us 489.000 millones. El venture capital (VC) regional se multiplicó decenas de veces. El ecosistema ya es potente, pero la revolución recién comienza y el potencial es enorme. En la próxima década el ecosistema puede valer más de $us 2 billones y generar más de $us 30.000 millones al año de inversiones.\\n\\n“El epicentro de la revolución es Brasil, que representa la mitad de los startups y del capital invertido. Fuera de este país, Argentina se destaca tanto por el valor creado por sus startups (45% del valor de toda la región) como por la cantidad de empresas que valen más de $us 1.000 millones”, explica Ignacio Peña, autor del informe y fundador de la consultora en innovación Surfing Tsunamis.\\n\\nVeneta Andonova, experta en estrategia empresarial en contextos emergentes y decana de la Facultad de Administración de la colombiana Universidad de los Andes, destaca que la industria tecnológica es global y depende de ideas, talento y educación; no del funcionamiento de entes políticos.\\n\\n“Esto representa una ventaja para los países emergentes como Argentina. Muchos proyectos que se basan en tecnologías digitales tienen mayor resiliencia ante las carencias institucionales. Además, los fondos de inversión de riesgo que tienen interés en emprendimientos tecnológicos tienen una tolerancia al riesgo y apuestan a crecimientos muy acelerados para la recuperación de su inversión.\\n\\nEn este sentido, el interés entre los inversionistas en proyectos digitales y tecnológicos en Argentina no es sorprendente, ya que es un país que tiene un excelente pool de talento técnico”, afirmó Andonova. Otro punto fundamental a tener en cuenta, según la decana, es que en Argentina nacieron los primeros unicornios de América Latina y esto puso al país en el mapa de los inversionistas de riesgo. “Esto creó un círculo virtuoso que inspiró a otros emprendedores a lanzar negocios digitales y escalables a escala regional. Se forjó una comunidad de emprendedores muy astutos y pensaron su negocio a gran escala desde el primer día, construyendo su propuesta de valor en el talento local”, enfatizó.\\n\\nHernán Kazah, cofundador de Kaszek Ventures, una de las mayores firmas de capital de riesgo en etapas tempranas de América Latina, afirma que en Argentina hay muy buenos emprendedores y sobre todo programadores. “No es casualidad que empresas como Mercado Libre, Globant, OLX, Despegar y Auth0, por ejemplo, hayan salido de este país”, sostuvo.\\n\\n¿Y el ecosistema boliviano?\\n\\nEn Bolivia, el cofundador de tuGerente, Javier Román, señala que no existe ningún fondo de inversión en startups y que hay muy pocos ‘business angels’ y empresas invirtiendo en startup. “Si buscamos desarrollar las startups, y por lo tanto la innovación, la competitividad y la mejora de la vida de los ciudadanos de Bolivia, debemos invertir en startups de Bolivia. Lo hacen en Argentina, Brasil, Chile, Perú, Colombia, Ecuador, México. En el momento que comiencen a haber montos considerables de inversión en Bolivia, comenzaremos a tener startups cada vez más grandes y exitosas”, reflexionó.\\n\\nSin embargo, dijo que las startups pueden ser muy exitosas sin llegar a ser unicornios. Afirmó que si una startup crece y es adquirida por $us 500 millones, nadie dirá que ha sido un fracaso, todo lo contrario, sería el más grande éxito desde el punto de vista financiero. Y, sin embargo, esa startup no ha llegado a una valuación de $us 1 billón (lo que lo convierte en unicornio)”, exclamó Román.\\n\\nTal cual menciona el artículo, a decir de Viviana Angulo, experta en emprendimiento, jefa de Mapeo de Solucione PNUD y fundadora de Pista 8, los ecosistemas proveen los insumos para construir propuestas de valor emprendedoras y son el primer campo de prueba en el cual pueden pivotear los estímulos de cada contexto. Al igual que muchos otros países con ecosistemas incipientes y con retos coyunturales diversos tienen el potencial de proyectar emprendimientos altamente resilientes.\\n\\n“En Bolivia tenemos un ecosistema en una fase en la cual la inversión en emprendimiento o venture capital, es el ingrediente que falta y que puede acelerar los procesos hacia una dinamización de emprendimientos escalables capaces de atraer y generar conocimiento y también inversión inteligente”, exclamó Angulo.',\n",

              " 'Escucha esta nota aquí\\n\\nEl madrileño es el disco del momento. Más de cinco millones de streams en las primeras 24 horas, lo convierten en el mejor debut de un artista español en la historia de Spotify (ha sido el primer español que llega al top 10 global de la plataforma).\\n\\nResponsable de este fenómeno es C. Tangana, el artista español, que comenzó como rapero y se pasó a la música urbana hasta llegar a este disco, que marca una nueva etapa del músico, que ha sido impulsor de la carrera de Rosalía, su expareja.\\n\\n_¿En qué momento de tu vida se gesta El madrileño?\\n\\nEl disco nace un poco porque me sentía harto de lo que venía haciendo desde hace tres años. Tenía 27, 28 años y estaba en un momento de mi carrera muy bueno, en el que daba muchos conciertos, tenía colaboraciones internacionales con artistas del urbano, estábamos ‘pegaos’, como quien dice. Y me di cuenta de que mi ambición comercial estaba por otro lado y, aunque hacía lo que me gustaba, no era algo que me llenaba completamente. Entonces, me puse manos a la obra y empezó todo esto, que hoy se llama El madrileño.\\n\\n_Es un disco que traza puentes en esta época, en la que el contacto es tan mezquino. Si no fuera por la pandemia, ¿qué hubiera sido de El madrileño?\\n\\nLa pandemia me ha ayudado a tomar la decisión de querer ir con este disco, porque yo tenía otro preparado. Me ayudó a darme cuenta de qué cosas merecían la pena realmente. Y lo que hice fue dedicarme a eso.\\n\\n_Venías de hacer colaboraciones con Natti Natasha y Becky G, ¿qué ocurre en ese trayecto?¿cómo terminas grabando un disco con colaboraciones de la talla de Jorge Drexler, Andrés Calamaro, José Feliciano, Toquiño y los Gipsy Kings?\\n\\nLo que quería era enfatizar esta otra parte, a la que me lleva la ambición artística. Efectivamente, si cualquier ejecutivo de la compañía ve el plan de El madrileño, te hubiera dicho que es una locura, que ya estaba a un nivel de estatus y de popularidad y, de repente, me voy para otro lado. Pero yo necesitaba hacer eso, además, está demostrado que a la gente le interesa ver a los artistas con una perspectiva nueva. Es un disco, que tiene una producción similar a la de música urbana, pero con toda una mezcla de estilos y resulta que a mucha gente eso le interesa. Se trata de ser capaces de salirnos del mainstream y ver todo desde afuera. Puede que te gusten las hamburguesas, pero, al final, te hartas de comerlas todos los días, y te das cuenta de que, si alguien se gira para otro lado y mira para otra dirección, la gente también se puede enganchar.\\n\\n_Uno ve los videos de Nominao y Hong Kong y se nota que se divirtieron con Drexler y Calamaro, ¿qué destacas de haber trabajado con ellos?\\n\\nSon dos artistas gigantes, para mí son el yin y el yang. Drexler es el intelectual, el profesor, mientras que Calamaro es el rocanrol, la pasión y la desinhibición. Ambos son grandes escritores de canciones y han tenido mucha influencia en mi adolescencia. El tiempo con cada uno es una forma distinta, son completamente diferentes, pero siempre es inspirador. Siento que para ellos también ha sido así; de repente, un chaval que viene de otro sitio y que les propone estas locuras, les ha parecido muy bien.\\n\\n_Unos de los trabajos en conjunto más exitoso que has realizado es el disco El mal querer, de Rosalía, en el que participas en ocho de los 11 temas, entre ellos el ganador del Grammy, Malamente. ¿A qué atribuyes el éxito de la cantante española?\\n\\nPara mí era como un secreto a voces que Rosalía iba a tener éxito. Con la primera vez que la escuché y conocí su proyecto y de su visión, me bastó para darme cuenta de que iba a ser una de las principales estrellas de la música española. Yo tenía claro que era algo que tenía que pasar tarde temprano. Por supuesto, como todos los españoles, estoy muy orgulloso por lo que ha conseguido.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

              " 'Por Homero Carvalho Oliva\\n\\nEl gobierno decretó cuarentena. Aislamiento preventivo para evitar contagiarse. Abastecerse de desinfectantes, jabón sólido y líquido, alcohol en gel, víveres, agua, vino, dulces, libros. Lavarse las manos es imprescindible, hacerlo al llegar de la calle, antes y después de preparar la comida, luego de ir al baño, si tocaste un pasamano, el celular o algún electrodoméstico. Lavarse. Lavarse. Lavarse, esa es la consigna, lavarse. Evitar salir, si tenemos que salir, debemos lavarnos las manos durante un minuto, desinfectar la ropa y lavarla con lavandina; dejar los zapatos en la puerta luego de rociarlos con Lysol. Aparecieron los primeros muertos en el país. Se extremaron medidas. Solo se puede salir un día a la semana. Lavarse. Lavarse. Los muertos se multiplican por el mundo, en Guayaquil los tiran a la calle. En nuestras ciudades hasta filman la tragedia de los que están muriendo, “tenemos las imágenes”, Morir ya no es digno. Habría que lavar las pantallas de los televisores y remojar en salmuera la conciencia de los conductores de programas televisivos. Lavarse las manos; lavar la ropa, las verduras, las conservas, todos los recipientes, los muebles, el piso, lavar todo. Todo, no olvidarse de nada, puede ser peligroso. Solo puedo salir los lunes, compro jabón, desinfectantes y alimentos. Leer la etiqueta de los jabones y cerciorarse si tienen desinfectante. Lavarse las manos, lavar la ropa… no, mejor tirarla junto con los zapatos. Así evitamos meter el virus a nuestros hogares. Ya no sé en qué día estoy. 90 días, cien días… Usé mi último barbijo y mis últimos guantes. No puedo salir, en la calle detienen a los que andan sin tapabocas. Ahora hago pedidos. Después de que traen los víveres y los jabones tiro la ropa a la basura, ya ni sé para que servían los zapatos. Lavarse las manos después de ir de un cuarto a otro porque por las ventanas se puede contrabandear el virus. Cerrar todo. Creo que de tanto lavar mis manos están muy delgadas, la piel se ha vuelto transparente, veo las falanges. Miro mis manos, toco mi cara, mis manos están frías. Mejor bañarse seguido, ya no tengo pelos en la cabeza, me los arranqué porque dicen que el virus puede anidar en los cabellos y también me depilé. No sé por qué no aparece el chico de los mandados, ya no viene ningún delivery, mejor que no vengan, viene de estar con otra gente, es peligroso, puede contagiarme. Esta noche volveré a lavar mis huesos, uno por uno, los enjuagaré con lavandina, los desinfectaré y los guardaré en un baúl con naftalina. Toda precaución es poca. Debo sobrevivir.\\n\\nPUBLICIDAD',\n",

              " 'El exsenador del Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS), Omar Aguilar, indicó en días precedentes, que los procesos que lleva adelante el ministro de Justicia, Iván Lima, contra la expresidenta Jeanine Añez son “incongruentes”.\\n\\n“O eres golpista o eres presidenta y si eres golpista no puedes ser enjuiciada por responsabilidades en calidad de presidenta (…); el ministro debe corregir ese tema”, manifestó Aguilar en entrevista con radio Compañera.\\n\\nEn criterio de Aguilar, Jeanine Añez debe ser procesada en juicio de responsabilidades, principalmente por el Decreto Supremo con el que autorizó a las Fuerzas Armadas (FFAA) y la Policía Boliviana el uso de las armas.\\n\\nExplicó que los artículos 137 al 140 de la Constitución Política de Estado (CPE) establecen los estados de excepción, y ni en ellos se le permite a las Fuerzas Armadas (FFAA) el uso de armas.\\n\\n“Por encima de todo está el respeto a los Derechos Humanos y el respeto a la vida, por eso considero que Jeanine Añez debe ser juzgada en un juicio de responsabilidades”, apuntó.\\n\\nEl 15 de noviembre de 2019, la entonces presidenta Jeanine Añez aprobó el Decreto Supremo 4078, que eximía de responsabilidad penal a las Fuerzas Armadas (FFAA) en caso de “legítima defensa o estado de necesidad”.\\n\\nEn la oportunidad, Añez justificó la medida porque el país enfrentaba acciones violentas debido a la crisis política que se desató tras las elecciones presidenciales del 20 de octubre de 2019. La Organización de Estados Americanos (OEA) realizó una auditoría del proceso electoral en la que encontró actos irregulares.\\n\\nEl 29 de noviembre de 2019, Añez revocó el Decreto Supremo porque volvió la paz al país.\\n\\n“Hemos decidido abrogar el Decreto Supremo 4078. Esta determinación ha sido tomada en consideración a que gracias a Dios y a la comprensión de todos los sectores del país hemos logrado la ansiada pacificación”, dijo Añez en la oportunidad.\\n\\nSUCESIÓN\\n\\nEl exlegislador manifestó que no se cumplieron los procedimientos para la sucesión de mando al igual que en 2003, empero, en 2019, todas las organizaciones sociales terminaron reconociéndola en Palacio Quemado. “La misma Asamblea terminó reconociéndola porque trabajamos emitiendo leyes sancionadas para que se promulgue por el Ejecutivo. Por eso creo que Iván Lima comete un error garrafal porque en conferencia de prensa, después de que Jeanine Añez fue enviada con detención preventiva dijo textualmente: Nosotros no estamos buscando cuatro meses sino 30 años de cárcel y para eso vamos a presentar todas las pruebas respecto al golpe, segundos después Lima menciona que se está preparando cuatro juicios de responsabilidades en contra de Jeanine Añez y buscará caso de corte y la procesará por el Tribunal Supremo de Justicia, ahí hay una incongruencia”, apuntó Aguilar.\\n\\nAñez llegó de Trinidad, la tarde del 11 de noviembre de 2019 a la Asamblea Legislativa para asumir la Presidencia del Senado, porque días antes renunciaron Adriana Salvatierra como titular y el primer vicepresidente Rubén Medinacelli, ambos del MAS.\\n\\nLa tarde del día 12, la senadora Añez llamó a sesión donde no se presentaron los legisladores del MAS, argumentando falta de garantías. Tras asumir la cabeza del Senado, se aplicó la sucesión presidencial del artículo 169 de la Constitución Política del Estado (CPE)\\n\\nPUBLICIDAD\\n\\nSENADORA\\n\\nEl 13 de marzo de 2021, el ministro de Justicia, Iván Lima, aclaró que Jeanine Añez es procesada en calidad de exsenadora por una demanda instaurada por la exdiputada del Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS), Lidia Patty, en diciembre de 2020, y no como expresidenta.\\n\\n“En este momento estamos ante un juicio a una exsenadora, por lo tanto, no corresponde un juicio de privilegio constitucional y esa es la realidad de los hechos, cuando se la juzgue como expresidenta se tendrá que evaluar en qué caso va a la Asamblea y si autoriza el enjuiciamiento, en este caso estamos ante un juicio ordinario”, explicó Lima a la estatal Patria Nueva.\\n\\nEl artículo 151, parágrafo I de la CPE señala: “Las asambleístas y los asambleístas gozarán de inviolabilidad personal durante el tiempo de su mandato y con posterioridad a este, por las opiniones, comunicaciones, representaciones, requerimientos, interpelaciones, denuncias, propuestas, expresiones o cualquier acto de legislación, información o fiscalización que formulen o realicen en el desempeño de sus funciones no podrán ser procesados penalmente”.\\n\\nTESTIMONIOS DESVIRTÚAN IMPUTACIÓN\\n\\nDespués que la Fiscalía argumentó que Jeanine Añez y otros legisladores de oposición obligaron a renunciar a los entonces presidentes de la Cámara de Senadores y Diputados, Adriana Salvatierra y Víctor Borda, respectivamente, en una reunión en la Universidad Católica Boliviana (UCB), los asistentes a la misma rechazaron el extremo y aseguraron que la expresidenta ni siquiera fue mencionada.\\n\\nEn la audiencia de medidas cautelares, que se realizó el domingo 14 de marzo de 2021, contra la expresidenta Jeanine Añez y dos de sus exministros, el fiscal de materia Harold Jarandilla argumentó que en una de las reuniones con la Iglesia Católica y la Unión Europea se obligó a la expresidenta del Senado, Adriana Salvatierra, renunciar a su cargo.\\n\\n“La reunión se realizó en la UCB, en la que estuvieron presentes Adriana Salvatierra, Teresa Morales, Samuel Doria Medina, Jorge Tuto Quiroga, Carlos D. Mesa, quienes le piden (a Salvatierra) que presente su renuncia irrevocable a su calidad de presidenta del Senado, con el objetivo que Jeanine Añez asuma la presidencia”, apuntó el fiscal.\\n\\nEl líder de Unidad Nacional (UN), Samuel Doria Medina, aseguró que la exmandataria ni siquiera fue mencionada en la reunión a la que él asistió por invitación del exministro de Justicia, Héctor Arce y Adriana Salvatierra.\\n\\nJorge Quiroga ratificó la versión de Doria Medina indicando que, en la reunión del 11 de noviembre de 2019, Salvatierra buscaba de forma “desesperada” que Evo Morales salga del país y se viabilice la sucesión constitucional.\\n\\nAl igual que Doria Medina, Quiroga aseguró que la entonces segunda vicepresidenta del Senado, Jeanine Añez, no participó de ninguna de esas reuniones, ya que se encontraba en el Beni y más bien se buscaba los medios de transporte para trasladarla a La Paz.\\n\\nEn un video de enero de 2020, la expresidenta del Senado Adriana Salvatierra desmiente que haya recibido presión para renunciar y que su decisión política fue coordinada con Evo Morales y Álvaro García, además de las “organizaciones sociales” del MAS.\\n\\nEn entrevista con Radio Fides, el expresidente de la Cámara de Diputados, Víctor Borda, aseguró el lunes 15 de marzo de 2021 que nadie lo obligó a renunciar a la presidencia de la Cámara de Diputados.\\n\\nEl pasado viernes, mediante su cuenta en Twitter, la exdiputada del Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS), Susana Rivero, se refirió a los documentos que maneja la Procuraduría General sobre el caso de supuesta conspiración, sedición y terrorismo, que es la base para afirmar que en Bolivia hubo un “golpe de Estado” entre el 10 y 12 de noviembre de 2019, “gestado” por Añez y las FFAA, como interpretó el ministro de Justicia, Iván Lima, en una reciente entrevista con radio Deseo.\\n\\n“Leí memorial de Subprocurador en caso golpe. En él se distorsiona lo sucedido en reuniones 11 y 12 de noviembre 2019. Por mi responsabilidad con Bolivia aclaro que es impreciso afirmar que nos comunicaron que Jeanine sería presidenta y que ya tenía apoyo de FFAA”, escribió Rivero.\\n\\nRivero fue parte de la comisión del MAS que se reunió con la oposición en ambientes de la UCB, luego de la renuncia de Morales, su segundo Álvaro García y los presidentes del Senado y Diputados, Adriana Salvatierra y Víctor Borda, respectivamente. La senadora cruceña y la exministra de Desarrollo, Teresa Morales completaron la comitiva oficialista.\\n\\nLas tres mujeres tenían como misión resguardar la salida del país de Morales y García, quienes viajaron a México la noche del 11 de noviembre, en calidad de asilados en territorio extranjero, cumpliendo la figura de abandono de funciones del art. 170 de la CPE.\\n\\nPor la oposición participaron los líderes políticos Carlos Mesa, Samuel Doria Medina, Jorge Quiroga, los abogados Jerjes Justiniano, Luis Vásquez, los asesores Ricardo Paz y Roberto Moscoso, y el senador Oscar Ortiz. De la sociedad civil participaron los miembros del Consejo Nacional de Defensa de la Democracia (Conade), Waldo Albarracín, Rolando Villena y Juan Carlos Núñez.\\n\\n“El 11 de noviembre Adriana y Teresa no hablaron nada mientras no se garantizara la vida de Evo y Álvaro. El 12 tocamos procedimientos y dejamos bien claro que no podíamos tocar más temas porque no habíamos hablado con la bancada. A uno de ellos se les salió que tenían plan B (…) Nosotras ni sabíamos cuál era ese plan. Lo vimos recién en la tardecita en la tele como todos, por lo que no pueden insinuarse cosas que no pasaron”, acotó Rivero.\\n\\nEl “plan b” que expresó la oposición fue activar la sucesión constitucional, luego de 48 horas de vacío de poder en Bolivia.\\n\\nJarandilla afirmó que el 12 de noviembre, dos días después de la renuncia de Evo Morales, Añez se autoproclamó como presidenta de la Asamblea Legislativa y finalmente asumió el mandato del país.\\n\\nLo que no tomó en cuenta el fiscal es que el 10 de noviembre, cuando Morales y García presentaron su renuncia, ya habían renunciado el presidente de la Cámara de Diputados, el primer vicepresidente del Senado, Rubén Medinacelli y Adriana Salvatierra, extremos que dejaron un vacío de poder en el país y una horda violenta que se acrecentaba causando zozobra en la ciudadanía, principalmente en la sede de Gobierno, donde varias estaciones policiales habían sido tomadas, viviendas particulares quemadas, medios de comunicación cerrados por amenazas y todas las actividades.',\n",

Y ahora que el Gobierno sigue sin plan y un norte difuso, urge la necesidad de reformas estructurales.\\n\\n“Todos los esfuerzos recaudacionistas van en contra del sector privado, de las familias y del aparato productivo en general”, apuntó.\\n\\nObservaciones\\n\\nVarios economistas ya señalaron que la actual ley impositiva requeriría una actualización, en el marco de la nueva constitución, ya que requiere la incorporación de nuevos sectores, como los cocaleros o los mineros cooperativistas.\\n\\nLa informalidad aumentó debido a la presión tributaria, y muchos emprendimientos prefieren operar al margen de las normas debido a la burocracia y a la imposición de nuevos impuestos y la fiscalización, y las multas.\\n\\nAunque en reiteradas oportunidades las autoridades nacionales rechazaron de que en Bolivia la presión tributaria sea alta a comparación los vecinos, los datos muestran que están por encima de algunas naciones.\\n\\nEn 2019, se informó que la presión tributaria en Bolivia llega a sólo al 17,7 % (incluidos los impuestos que recauda la Aduana Nacional) del Producto Interno Bruto (PIB).\\n\\nPUBLICIDAD',\n",
              " 'Dos analistas alertaron ayer que con el proyecto de ley enviado por el presidente Luis Arce a la Asamblea Legislativa para ampliar el Impuesto al Valor Agregado (IVA) a los servicios de las grandes plataformas digitales en destino, hasta los niños pagarán impuesto por bajar un libro o escuchar música en una computadora o en un teléfono celular.\\n\\nLos analistas Manuel Morales y Julio Alvarado consideran que la intención del presidente Arce muestra que la economía del Estado “está muy mal” y el Gobierno “está dando pataleos de ahogado” ante la crisis económica que ya se empezó a vivir.\\n\\nMorales no descarta que la primera reacción del pueblo sea parecida a lo que ocurre en Colombia, donde la población se oponga en las calles a este tipo de medidas. Un impuesto al internet, a los servicios adicionales y a bajar información prácticamente es un atentado contra la educación, indicó.\\n\\n“La mayoría de los niños en Bolivia que tienen internet y hacen descargas tendrían pagar impuestos, lo cual es absolutamente demencial y contra derecho a la educación. Por ese motivo esa norma debe ser rechazada de plano”, manifestó.\\n\\nSostuvo que los investigadores y los que trabajan bajo la modalidad del teletrabajo también serían afectados.\\n\\nObservó que desde que fue planteado el proyecto de ley, la gente ha expresado en las redes sociales su inclinación hacia una resistencia frontal a la sola idea que exista un impuesto a los servicios digitales, más aún si ya está vigente la educación a distancia en universidades y colegios particulares.\\n\\nAlvarado por su lado advierte que los sectores vulnerables serán los más afectados porque, apenas lograron comprarse un celular para pasar clases virtuales, ahora tendrán que pagar impuestos. “Esto va contra toda lógica. En vez de facilitar el acceso al internet, en un país donde las tarifas son tan caras, convierten al internet en un servicio de lujo y no de primera necesidad”, manifestó.\\n\\nConsidera que el Gobierno debería ser más sincero ante la población y admitir que ya no tiene plata porque la aplicación del impuesto va a traer problemas, especialmente en la educación, peor si en Bolivia se dio inicio a la educación virtual.\\n\\n“Ahora para bajar un libro se deberá pagar impuesto, participar en una conferencia virtual, igual. El gobierno actúa en el mismo sentido que Iván Duque en Colombia aplicando impuestos en plena pandemia, afectando a los más pobres, pudiendo acudir a otras fuentes como cobrar impuesto a los importadores de autos chutos”, comentó Alvarado.\\n\\nALCANCE DEL PROYECTO\\n\\nSegún el proyecto de Ley 164-20 modificatorio de la Ley 843, se amplía el IVA a los servicios provistos desde el exterior, que sean consumidos, utilizados o explotados en territorio nacional, tales como: intermediación en la compra venta de bienes o servicios de cualquier naturaleza; suministro, descarta, streaming o transferencia por cualquier tipo de tecnología, de videos, música, juegos, textos, revistas, libros y otros análogos.\\n\\nTambién alcanzaría al suministro de software, almacenamiento, plataformas o infraestructura informática, difusión de publicidad por cualquier soporte o medio digital y “cualquier otro servicio digital no contemplado” anteriormente.\\n\\nPrecisa que el servicio digital es consumido, utilizado, prestado o explotado en Bolivia, cuando la transferencia, descarga o recepción mediante internet u otra tecnología se realice a un dispositivo del usuario con una dirección IP (Protocolo de internet) o SIM del teléfono móvil u otro mecanismo de geolocalización que esté situado en territorio nacional.\\n\\nSi bien declara como sujetos pasivos a los proveedores o intermediarios del exterior, la misma norma indica que el hecho imponible se perfeccionará en el momento de su consumo, utilización o explotación en territorio nacional. Añade que la base imponible estará constituida por el precio abonado al proveedor quien incorporará este impuesto dentro del precio total del servicio sobre la cual se aplicará el 13%.\\n\\nAlvarado cree que estas empresas no van a pagar el impuesto sino la van a cargar al consumidor, por tanto, esto solamente afectará la economía de la población. “Va a ser una demagogia del gobierno decir que cobrarán impuesto a las grandes plataformas; eso es falso. El impuesto pagará la empresa que nos presta el servicio, Entel, Axes, Tigo y no las grandes transnacionales”, advirtió.\\n\\nEn Bolivia las páginas más visitadas son Google, Youtube, Bongacams.com, Google.com.bo, Facebook, Zoom y Live de reuniones virtuales. La plataforma de Streaming como lo son Netflix y Twitch también se encuentran en el top, según el digital yiminshum.com. En Bolivia habría 8.2 millones de usuarios en redes sociales y existiría 12.16 millones de conexiones móviles o línea telefónicas que interactúan con grandes plataformas digitales.

              " 'José Manuel Caballero Bonald falleció a los 94 años en Madrid. La noticia la ha dado a las 8.08 de la mañana del domingo Josefa Ramis, su esposa, con la que se casó en Mallorca hace 61 años y con la que tuvo cinco hijos: “Se acabó”, dijo a sus amigos, para los que él era Pepe igual que ella es Pepa. Durante meses de enfermedad ella ha sido la voz del escritor, premio Cervantes en 2012, poeta, novelista y autor de unas memorias imprescindibles.\\n\\nCaballero Bonald, para el que el día y la noche no tenían límites, dejó de hacer vida pública mucho antes de la pandemia. El cáncer de piel le había producido unas “averías” “así las llamaba” de las que no quiso hacer exhibición. Se hacía raro ver en el dique seco a un hombre que tuvo siete vidas, cien oficios “profesor de literatura, lexicógrafo, editor, productor musical” y otros tantos amigos. Para celebrar su Premio Cervantes le prestaron por un año la llave de una bodega de Jerez, su ciudad natal, para que entrara a cualquier hora y con quien él quisiera. Lo contaba con la satisfacción de un niño, como si su carrera literaria cobrara por fin sentido y el discurso de Alcalá de Henares delante del Rey hubiera sido un peaje hacia esa llave mágica.\\n\\nEl poeta, novelista y ensayista nació el 11 de noviembre de 1926. Su padre era cubano criollo y la familia de su madre era de origen francés asentada en Andalucía desde mediados del siglo XIX. Tras pasar la Guerra Civil entre Jerez y Sanlúcar, estudió Náutica y Astronomía en Cádiz, disciplinas que cambió por Filosofía y Letras en Sevilla y Madrid, ciudad en la que se instaló en 1951.\\n\\nEse año ganó con su primer libro, Las adivinaciones, el accésit del Premio Adonáis, el galardón que consagró a su generación, a los niños de la guerra que se dieron a conocer en los años cincuenta.\\n\\n1960 fue otro año clave. Se casó con Pepa Ramis, su compañera de toda la vida, y se trasladó a Bogotá como profesor de literatura en la Universidad Nacional. “Si la patria es lo que se ve desde la ventana de la casa donde uno vive a gusto”, solía decir, “yo tengo varias patrias; unas más duraderas que otras: el Coto de Doñana, Jerez, Mallorca, Madrid, Bogotá… En Colombia estuve tres años y allí escribí mi primera novela, tuve mi primer hijo. Me acuerdo mucho de esa patria mía. La que no me gusta nada es la patria de los patriotas españoles”.\\n\\nConsagrado entre los poetas jóvenes, en Bogotá, efectivamente, se convirtió en novelista con Dos días de septiembre, que recibió el premio Biblioteca Breve de 1961, un galardón en el que le sucedió Mario Vargas Llosa con La ciudad y los perros. Centrada en la sociedad estamental y clasista del vino de Jerez, Caballero Bonald terminó repudiando esa novela por “demasiado deudora” de la estética social triunfante durante la posguerra\\n\\nMúsica y matemáticas\\n\\nSus dudas sobre el “formalismo temático” en que se tradujo muchas veces el compromiso antifranquista ‘que en 1966 dio con sus huesos en la cárcel de Carabanchel por un mes’ hicieron que desdeñase otro de sus libros, esta vez de poesía: Pliegos de cordel (1963). Su obra poética completa, reunida en el volumen Somos el tiempo que nos queda, reúne títulos como Descrédito del héroe (1977), premio de la Crítica al año siguiente, Laberinto de Fortuna (1984), Diario de Argónida (1997) o libros nacidos, en plena vejez, de una particular mezcla de indignación cívica y exigencia estética: Manual de infractores (2005), La noche no tiene paredes (2009), Entreguerras (2012) y Desaprendizajes (2015).\\n\\nOtra de las facetas de un hombre que tuvo mil es, precisamente, la musical. En 1969 firmó otra obra magna: el Archivo del cante flamenco, un álbum de seis discos y estudio preliminar grabado para la compañía Vergara.\\n\\nA finales de los años cincuenta, Caballero Bonald fue subdirector de una revista clave para la cultura de la posguerra, la interior y la del exilio, Papeles de Son Armadans, fundada por Cela en Palma de Mallorca. El desencuentro entre ambos terminaría, cuarenta años después, enturbiando el frustrado ingreso del poeta en la RAE. Después de quedarse fuera por un solo voto cuando era el único candidato, lo dejó estar para siempre y se sentó a esperar todos los premios, que llegaron bajo el nombre de Nacional de Literatura, Nacional de las Letras, Reina Sofía de Poesía y, finalmente, el Cervantes.

Tras varias décadas de desarrollo y con Red Hat a la cabeza por más de 25 años, el modelo open source -abierto y colaborativo- se está volviendo el estándar para toda la industria.\\n\\nRed Hat no inventó este modelo de desarrollo de soluciones de software que hoy distingue a nuestra compañía en el mundo. Por el contrario, nosotros “fuimos creados” por este modelo de desarrollo que surgió desde las comunidades globales de Linux a inicios de los años ‘90, cuando algunos desarrolladores más visionarios entendieron el potencial que el código abierto podía ofrecer al mundo empresarial.\\n\\nPUBLICIDAD\\n\\nEl modelo open source pasó a ser no sólo un modo de crear tecnología, sino también una forma abierta de trabajo, que prioriza el open management, la transparencia, la meritocracia, la inclusión y una visión más colaborativa del mundo. Esto nos ha conducido naturalmente hacia un cambio de paradigma, y en lo personal estoy seguro de que el panorama global no sería el mismo sin la relevancia que pudo adquirir el mundo del open source.\\n\\nEn Red Hat entendimos que esta forma de trabajo revolucionaria debía extenderse más allá de nuestras oficinas. Sin una red sólida y consistente con nuestros partners de negocios a lo largo del mundo, Red Hat no sería lo que es hoy. El ecosistema de partners de Red Hat ha sido siempre el factor multiplicador de la comunidad open source y la fuerza motriz del éxito de nuestros clientes.

              " 'La aplicación de un IVA sobre estos servicios es una potestad que muchos gobiernos en la región han ejercido con distintas fórmulas y con distintos resultados hasta la fecha. En buena parte de los casos, se han adoptado sistemas que buscan retener a través de los bancos y emisores de tarjetas de crédito y débito el porcentaje del IVA sobre cada transacción que se procesa sobre el consumo de un servicio digital, como portales de comercio electrónico, apps y marketplaces.\\n\\nSin embargo, la aplicación de estos impuestos puede generar distorsiones en el consumo de servicios digitales, que están siendo vitales para millones de usuarios dada las condiciones de la pandemia. Servicios como los de teleeducación, comercio electrónico de bienes y servicios esenciales, aplicaciones de movilidad y de delivery, servicios de streaming, teleconferencias, entre otros.\\n\\nAplicar un IVA en esta coyuntura implica castigar el bolsillo de los ciudadanos en el momento en que más necesitan consumir este tipo de servicios y tener la posibilidad de generar recursos, reactivar la economía y generar empleos.\\n\\nEn cuanto a mecanismos de recaudación, el IVA cobrado con el mecanismo de retención en las tarjetas de crédito o débito es discriminatorio e ineficiente, pues sólo gravará a las operaciones que se realicen con el pago a través de medios bancarios, dejando de lado los consumos en efectivo. Estos consumos pueden representar porcentajes importantes, en tanto el nivel de bancarización del país aún es bajo, con lo cual, una medida como esta perjudicará la penetración de medios bancarios en el mercado.\\n\\nAsimismo, los bancos no cuentan con los sistemas e información necesaria para determinar la base imponible del impuesto, esto debido a que muchas compañías de servicios digitales utilizan esquemas de cobros variables que pagan los usuarios, en función a factores como: tiempo de consumo, uso, acceso, tipo de paquete, etc. Esto se nota con mucha frecuencia en los servicios de las apps de movilidad y de delivery. Pero toda esta información no es reflejada en el cobro de la tarjeta de crédito o débito al usuario.\\n\\nCon lo cual, se creará una distorsión al aplicar el IVA sobre el total del monto cobrado a la tarjeta de crédito y/o débito, pese a que sólo un porcentaje menor de dicha transacción corresponde al servicio digital. Incluso si el impuesto sólo se aplica sobre las comisiones, los bancos no necesariamente tienen la información para saber la comisión exacta por cada consumo. Recientemente, en el Ecuador han existido múltiples problemas en la implementación de este tipo de impuestos.\\n\\nEn Colombia, el sistema de cumplimiento es directo por parte de compañías del exterior que prestan servicios digitales, para el pago del impuesto sobre las ventas (IVA). Para el efecto, la compañía del exterior hace su registro ante la autoridad administrativa mediante el Registro Único Tributario – RUT. incluyendo su responsabilidad como prestador de servicios del exterior y posteriormente, se encarga de recaudar, presentar y pagar el impuesto en un formato especial y simplificado que se ha designado para el efecto. En el caso de Colombia, el recaudo del IVA por entidades emisoras de tarjeta crédito se tiene contemplado solo de manera supletoria.\\n\\nEn el caso de Ecuador, han existido múltiples problemas de implementación del IVA, con cobros excesivos a los usuarios por operaciones que no debían estar gravadas o porque se ha aplicado la tasa del impuesto sobre el total de un consumo cuando solo una parte del mismo correspondía a un servicio digital. Esto se dio en el caso de las apps de movilidad y de delivery.\\n\\nEn el caso boliviano esta claro que una medida de estas estas características será oportuno en tanto y cuanto se permita a las empresas extranjeras inscribirse ante la autoridad tributaria para declarar y pagar el impuesto, eso permitirá que no haya distorsiones en el consumo. El caso colombiano quizás es un buen referente para su valoración evitando que toda la carga impositiva recaiga en el ciudadano de a pie que hoy por hoy dada las circunstancias de post pandemia está más empobrecido que nunca.\\n\\nPor último, la discusión sobre la tributación de “servicios digitales” o de la Economía Digital, es una discusión de carácter global que viene siendo abordada por la OCDE para formular una propuesta que permita un régimen de tributación transfronteriza coherente y que no genere distorsiones entre los países.\\n\\nLuis Sergio Valle\\n\\nEs presidente de la Fundación FUNDETIC-BOLIVIA\\n\\nPUBLICIDAD',\n",
              " 'Bolivia, mayo 2021.- El ritmo de la vida moderna ha generado múltiples cambios en la rutina y la vida de miles de personas, especialmente, en cuanto a los hábitos alimenticios y de ejercicio. Pero también, uno de los cambios más evidentes, es respecto al sueño; tanto en calidad como en cantidad. En la actualidad, el tiempo dedicado a esta necesidad básica ha disminuido drásticamente a raíz de nuevas preocupaciones del hogar, académicas o laborales.\\n\\nEl sueño juega un papel muy importante para el óptimo funcionamiento físico y mental del ser humano, y gozar de una buena rutina de sueño aporta una gran variedad de beneficios. A continuación, mencionamos algunos de ellos:\\n\\n– Al dormir las células se regeneran y oxigenan con mayor facilidad. Específicamente en los ojos, la Rodopsina (pigmento sensible a la luz) logra renovarse recuperándose del esfuerzo realizado durante el día.\\n\\n– El dormir bien disminuye el riesgo de contraer enfermedades como la hipertensión o diabetes, ya que tener buenos hábitos de sueño disminuyen la producción de hormonas como el cortisol, también conocida como la “hormona del estrés”.\\n\\n– Durante el sueño también disminuye la frecuencia cardíaca, esto favorece el trabajo de reparación que hacen las células coronarias y los tejidos. En este momento el organismo también libera la melatonina, conocida como la hormona del sueño y la hormona del crecimiento.\\n\\n– Dormir bien es fundamental para mejorar la capacidad intelectual. El cerebro necesita desconectarse varias horas para así procesar toda la información que acumuló durante el día.\\n\\n– Una actividad psicomotriz no se puede ejecutar correctamente si el cerebro no está descansado.\\n\\nDesde hace ya varios años, Huawei se ha comprometido a ayudar a sus usuarios a mejorar su bienestar de manera integral y en todas las etapas de su vida, por lo que ha desarrollado HUAWEI TruSleep, un rastreador de sueño de alto nivel que viene equipado con las más útiles herramientas para mejorar la calidad del sueño de forma sistemática. Los relojes inteligentes y las bandas de Huawei, como el Watch Fit o la Band 6 sirven como excelentes rastreadores del sueño, ya que con esta función el usuario podrá ajustar su frecuencia cardíaca y los datos de su respiración a su rutina de sueño, permitiéndole reconocer las etapas que este tiene (incluyendo la vigilia, el sueño REM, el sueño ligero y el sueño profundo) y con un alto grado de precisión, para un monitoreo completo. La naturaleza confiable de los datos recolectados asegura que el sueño sea alcanzado y calificado con precisión, con sugerencias personalizadas para mejorar la calidad del sueño que están basadas en ciencia sólida.\\n\\nToda esta información se sincroniza con su aplicación de salud y se cataloga para futuras referencias. Para activar esta función el usuario debe abrir la aplicación de Salud en su teléfono y seleccionar el dispositivo portátil vinculado, entrar a Monitoreo de Salud, y activar HUAWEI TruSleep.\\n\\nPUBLICIDAD',\n",

              " 'Estudio de psicológicos revelan que las cucarachas producen más miedo que las arañas y serpientes confirmaron expertos a Infobae, después de un estudio con varias especies.\\n\\nHay unas 30 especies de arañas en el mundo, cuyas mordeduras pueden matar a seres humanos y unas 600 especies de serpientes venenosas, de la cuales la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) define unas 200 “de importancia médica”.\\n\\nSin embargo, ninguna de ellas produce más rechazo, miedo o repulsión que las cucarachas, incluso cuando su presencia no puede interpretarse como una amenaza directa para la vida.\\n\\nAsí lo comprobaron investigadores españoles en un experimento con más de 400 participantes, quienes registraron su reacción tras exponerse a distintas imágenes de animales.\\n\\n“Nos llamó mucho la atención, no esperábamos que produjera una respuesta más negativa o desagradable que las serpientes y las arañas”, dijo a Infobae Jorge Grimaldos Grimaldos, investigador del Laboratorio de Psicología y Tecnología (LabPsiTec) que depende de la Universidad Jaume I, en Castellón, y de la Universidad de Valencia, en España.\\n\\nPara Grimaldos, el hallazgo sugiere que la fobia a las cucarachas está más extendida de lo que se supone y que no se relaciona necesariamente con el miedo.\\n\\n“La emoción de asco ante las cucarachas es tan intensa que facilita el desarrollo de una conducta fóbica ante un insecto que aparentemente no es peligroso, pero que tiene ese poder”, puntualizó.\\n\\nTradicionalmente, las serpientes y las arañas han sido los prototipos de animales cuyas imágenes se usan para provocar emociones desagradables en estudios específicos, por ejemplo, de neuroimágenes, explican Grimaldos y colegas del Departamento de Psicología Básica, Clínica y Psicobiología de la Universidad Jaume I (María Carmen Pastor, Juana Bretón-López y Soledad Quero) y de la Universidad de Salamanca (Almudena Duque).\\n\\nEl nuevo estudio, publicado en la revista Behavior Research Methods, buscaba validar si un conjunto de fotografías de cucarachas producía respuestas equivalentes, con el objeto de usar esa información en futuras investigaciones destinadas a comprender mejor los mecanismos involucrados en el origen y persistencia de esta fobia.\\n\\nPara hacerlo, los investigadores convocaron a 424 participantes, estudiantes de la Universidad Jaume I de 18 a 59 años, y los expusieron en distintos grupos a fotos de cucarachas, serpientes, arañas, mariposas y gatitos, a las que tenían que calificar en una escala de “valencia emocional” de 0 a 7 según el nivel de desagrado o agrado que esas imágenes les produjeran. También tenían que puntuar la intensidad de la emoción.\\n\\nLos hallazgos fueron sorprendentes. “Pensábamos que las cucarachas iban a ser una categoría negativa más… pero resultaron ser las más desagradables”, señaló Grimaldos. La medalla de oro en el podio del espanto, aunque tal vez disputarían su lugar con las ratas: “Habría que comprobar es si efectivamente su valor emocional es más negativo que el de las cucarachas o no. Desde luego, es una cuestión interesante”, opina el psicólogo.\\n\\nCEREBRO\\n\\nAlgo que intriga a Grimaldos y otros investigadores es cómo un insecto que, a priori, podría considerarse inofensivo, es capaz de despertar tamaña aversión.\\n\\nAunque no hay estadísticas confiables sobre la frecuencia de personas con fobias a las cucarachas, se sabe que es más habitual en zonas de clima cálido y húmedo, que es donde más prosperan, lo que apoyaría la idea de que el rechazo es cultural y no que está “impreso” en el cerebro.\\n\\n“Las fobias son mayores cuando el estímulo está presente”, subrayó Grimaldos, quien está haciendo su doctorado en ese tema.\\n\\n“La cucaracha siempre se ha asociado a la suciedad o a la enfermedad. Hay algo en ellas que, aunque sepas que no te puede morder, matar o producir ningún daño físico, provoca un asco muy intenso”, indicó.\\n\\n“Y eso tiene mucho que ver con la cultura, porque otros insectos anatómicamente muy similares, los escarabajos, no provocan esa reacción, los niños van por la playa y los agarran, aunque se los vea entre excrementos. En cambio, con las cucarachas, hay más bien una reacción cultural que se transmite por generaciones, de madres y padres a sus hijos: ‘¡Es una cucaracha asquerosa, no te acerques!, les gritan”, añadió Grimaldos.\\n\\n“La cucaracha siempre se ha asociado a la suciedad o a la enfermedad. Hay algo en ellas que, aunque sepas que no te puede morder, matar o producir ningún daño físico, provoca un asco muy intenso. Y eso tiene mucho que ver con la cultura, porque otros insectos anatómicamente muy similares, los escarabajos, no provocan esa reacción, los niños van por la playa y los agarran, aunque se los vea entre excrementos. En cambio, con las cucarachas, hay más bien una reacción cultural que se transmite por generaciones, de madres y padres a sus hijos: ‘¡Es una cucaracha asquerosa, no te acerques!, les gritan’”, añadió Grimaldos.\\n\\nLa gente que no tiene ese miedo no llega a entender cómo un animal tan insignificante puede provocar un nivel de malestar tan alto como para necesitar asistencia profesional, apunta Grimaldos, cuya pareja tiene esa fobia y conoce la situación de primera mano, además de los testimonios que recoge de los pacientes que trata.\\n\\n“Esas personas lo sufren mucho. En verano, que es cuando más hay, a partir de las 10 de la noche no salen a la calle; no pueden ponerse chanclas (ojotas), tienen que ir siempre con un calzado cerrado; cuando salen de sus casas, tienen que sellar con cinta todas las ventanas y todos los orificios del baño, y cada vez que entran tienen que revisar todos ambientes para comprobar que no haya ninguna. Y como se encuentren con alguna, la reacción es tan intensa que pueden llegar a llorar, temblar, dejar de hacer lo que hacían y pasar varios días recordando ese momento. Es una interferencia muy grande con la vida”, describió.\\n\\nEl psiquiatra Enzo Cascardo, presidente de la Asociación Argentina de Trastornos de Ansiedad (AATA), dice que el miedo fóbico no nace de un trauma puntual. “Sin duda estamos atravesados por patrones de crianza, pero también hay una vulnerabilidad que es genética”, argumenta a Infobae.\\n\\n“De las fobias específicas a insectos, la de las cucarachas es la más común. El solo hecho de anticipar la situación pone a los pacientes en un miedo muy intenso y en conductas evitativas. Hace un par de semanas tratamos a una joven que había encontrado una cucaracha en un departamento que había comprado y ya no quería vivir más ahí, había resuelto que la única solución que tenía era mudarse”, describe Cascardo, quien también dirige el Centro de Investigaciones Médicas en Ansiedad (CentroIMA).\\n\\nLas conductas evitativas pueden llegar a ser muy marcadas. Si alguna vez se cruzan con una cucaracha en un hotel o restaurante, no solo evitarán esos establecimientos particulares, sino que ya no querrán comer o dormir afuera en ningún otro lugar. “Solapadamente van a poner excusas para no ir, pero en el origen está la fobia”, subraya Cascardo. “Es una sensación paralizante”. (Infobae)\\n\\nPUBLICIDAD\\n\\nDetrás de paredes\\n\\nCientíficos sospechan que la reacción negativa a las cucarachas es una especie de “miedo ancestral, inconsciente”, que quizás no se relacione con una percepción de peligro\\n\\nEl miedo a las cucarachas se aviva por la intuición o convicción de que, por cada una que vemos, hay muchas otras invasoras que acechan escondidas. En la novela policial Cucarachas, de Jo Nesbø, el título no solo alude a los crujidos que el inspector Harry Hole oye durante las noches oscuras de su hotel de Bangkok, sino también a las múltiples tramas ocultas detrás de cada caso que sale a la luz.\\n\\nEn la última novela de Ian McEwan, La cucaracha (2020), una especie de reverso de La metamorfosis de Kafka, el insecto se convierte en humano y observa cómo una pequeña criatura, “sin dudas, el poseedor desplazado del cuerpo que ahora habitaba”, se desplaza por debajo de la puerta hacia un palacio cercano donde encontraría “detrás de los paneles o debajo de las tablas del piso, seguridad y consuelo entre millones de sus hermanos”.\\n\\n“No conozco de estudios que hayan medido la población de cucarachas. Pero, ciertamente, en las ciudades hay muchas más que ratas y que habitantes humanos. Y si se las encuentra de día fuera de sus escondites habituales, es un fuerte indicio de que el lugar está más infestado que si solo son vistas de noche”, dijo a Infobae el doctor en Biología Raúl Alzogaray, quien estudia desde hace 10 años su comportamiento y productos para controlarlas en el Centro de Investigaciones de Plagas e Insecticidas (CIPEIN), que pertenece a la Unidad de Investigación y Desarrollo Estratégico para la Defensa (Unidef) del Conicet y el Ministerio de Defensa.\\n\\nAdemás, Alzogaray explicó que, de las 4.500 especies de cucarachas, hay unas 30 asociadas a seres humanos y tres que son famosas como plagas porque están en todas partes, incluyendo la Argentina. En el interior de los hogares, la más habitual es Blattella germánica, también conocida como “la rubia” o “la alemana”.\\n\\n“Durante el día, suelen estar escondidas en todos los rincones: dentro de aparatos electrodomésticos o cajas de tomacorrientes, detrás de heladeras (donde aprovechan el calorcito de motor) o junto a cestos de basura. De noche tienen más actividad y van a buscar alimento, por eso es más común verlas al prender la luz”, señaló Alzogaray, para quien la primera recomendación contra ellas es la higiene: no dejar restos de comida o platos sucios en la mesada, poner una malla metálica en las rejillas, evitar que los residuos queden expuestos.\\n\\n“Tienen un olfato espectacular y les gusta comer lo que nos gusta a nosotros”, advirtió.\\n\\nEl entomólogo y divulgador científico sospecha que la reacción negativa a las cucarachas es una especie de “miedo ancestral, inconsciente”, que quizás no se relacione con una percepción de peligro. En la película Mimic, de 1997, dirigida por el ganador del Oscar Guillermo del Toro, una plaga de cucarachas enferma a los niños y obliga a combatirlas de una manera innovadora que resulta contraproducente.\\n\\nEn la realidad, Alzogaray explicó que estos insectos son “transmisores mecánicos”, que transportan virus, bacterias y hongos en sus patas, aunque es difícil atribuirles de manera fehaciente un cuadro de diarreas u otra enfermedad. Muchos médicos también vinculan su exposición con el desarrollo del asma.\\n\\nPUBLICIDAD\\n\\nTratamiento efectivo\\n\\nHAY QUE DIFERENCIAR EL MIEDO, QUE ES NORMAL, DE LA FOBIA.\\n\\nCuando el temor o el asco a las cucarachas son más que sobresaltos ocasionales e interfieren con la calidad de vida, es necesario buscar tratamiento. El psiquiatra Cascardo señala que, como ocurre con todas las fobias específicas, el enfoque más efectivo es la terapia cognitivo-conductual, en la que los pacientes tienen una exposición muy gradual y controlada al insecto.\\n\\n“Hay gente que no puede ni sentir la palabra cucaracha, y por eso empiezan por escribirla. Luego ven fotos, videos, una réplica de plástico, un ejemplar embalsamado… y al final de las sesiones, que pueden ser diez, se les muestra una cucaracha viva en un frasco. Es una terapia de exposición con muy buenos resultados”, aseguró Cascardo. En casos severos, se puede acompañar de algunos medicamentos.\\n\\nEl objetivo del tratamiento no es que la persona se enamore de las cucarachas y las adopte como mascotas, sino que pueda habituarse al temor y naturalizarlo como algo que comparte con el resto de la gente, añade el especialista.\\n\\n“Aunque la persona haya conseguido el éxito terapéutico, el animal no deja de producir asco. ¡La cucaracha en sí es un animal asqueroso! Pero el objetivo es poder interactuar con ella con un nivel de ansiedad normal y no salir corriendo, temblando o llorando”, destacó Grimaldos, quien junto a su equipo de investigación está actualmente probando un tratamiento de realidad aumentada que proyecta imágenes de cucarachas en una mesa. “Como la gente sabe que es una imagen y no el insecto real, facilita que vengan a tratarse”, explicó.\\n\\nCuando se trata de lidiar con criaturas que habitan el planeta desde antes que existieran los dinosaurios, lo mejor es el cambio interno. “Hay que diferenciar el miedo, que es normal, de la fobia. No pretendemos que los pacientes sean seres valientes que afronten todo, sino que naturalicen sus temores y dejen de ver afectada su calidad de vida”, concluyó Cascardo.',\n",

More than 70 bodies have been recovered from the river in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Local reports claim more than 100 bodies have been dumped into the river.\\n\\nThe discovery of bodies has triggered panic over the spread of Covid-19 through Ganga river water. Can rivers spread Covid-19?\\n\\nThis question involves answer to two other critical questions: Does Covid-19 spread from a dead body? Does Covid-19 spread through water?\\n\\nDoes Covid-19 spread from a dead body?\\n\\nThere is lack of clarity whether a dead body is infectious for Covid-19. Many experts dismiss the possibility of a dead body posing a Covid-19 risk. However, authorities continue to have body disposal protocol for Covid-19 cases.\\n\\nHealth agencies in India prescribe utmost care in the handling of the bodies of people succumbing to Covid-19. The guidelines issued by the Union health ministry and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) suggest there is a possibility of coronavirus infection in handling dead bodies.\\n\\nThey prescribe use of personal protective equipment (PPE) including masks and eyewear, hand sanitisation and also disinfecting of bag containing the dead body.\\n\\nREAD | Centre takes note of bodies being dumped in river Ganga, seeks report\\n\\nIn the UK, the guidance for care of the deceased with suspected or confirmed coronavirus (Covid-19), updated on April 22 this year, provide more elaborate protocols for different group of handlers including health workers, municipal professionals and family members or relatives.\\n\\nIt declares its objective as two-pronged to ensure that:\\n\\n“The deceased are treated with sensitivity, dignity and respect” — which did not happen in the case of the deceased whose bodies were found floating in Ganga in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.\\n\\n“People who need to come into contact with the deceased or who work in services providing care for the deceased are protected from infection”.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the US, however, the protocol is little different. It makes a distinction from highly infectious Ebola in the cases of deaths occurring from Covid-19. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says, “Based on what we know now, it is believed there is little risk of getting COVID-19 from a dead body.”\\n\\nHowever, even the CDC has a warning: “Family members can view the body but must stand at least 1 meter away from other persons viewing the body. They should not touch the body without taking precautions.”\\n\\nThe CDC also advises the use of gloves, gown, water and soap or diluted chlorine solution, mask, goggles or face cover “to protect from splashing of any body fluids”.\\n\\nThis takes us to the second question.\\n\\nALSO READ | These visuals will disturb you. Bodies float in Ganga in Bihar's Buxar as a nation mourns\\n\\nDoes Covid-19 spread through water?\\n\\nAccording to health experts and agencies, the SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19, spreads principally through respiratory droplets produced by an infected person during cough, sneeze, speech or breathing. Some of the droplets are very small, called aerosols, and they can be airborne over a distance greater than two metres.\\n\\nThis means that coronavirus stays safe in the water released by an infected person. Some studies have found evidence of coronavirus in faecal matter of infected persons. It is not certain, however, whether infected faecal matter can infect a healthy person. But body fluids may transmit coronavirus.\\n\\nHowever, there is no evidence to suggest that running water or even a swimming pool can be the route of transmission for SARS-CoV-2. Air in close contact remains the only proven route of Covid-19 transmission. Though, some studies have found SARS-CoV-2 in river and waste waters but with unproven transmissibility.\\n\\nIn its mythbusters series, the WHO says, “The Covid-19 virus does not transmit through water while swimming. However, the virus spreads between people when someone has close contact with an infected person.”\\n\\nNow, let us go back to the original question, whether dumping of bodies in river can spread Covid-19. The possibility of Covid-19 transmission is unlikely or only a theoretical possibility in the absence of enough research about whether aquatic life can transmit coronavirus from one species to another.\\n\\nYet, dead bodies are considered contagious and have a large number of bacteria and viruses that would only increase pollution levels in Ganga in this case. There could be other adverse impacts on health for those coming in direct contact with floating dead bodies.\\n\\nHowever, the discovery of dead bodies in Ganga is a tale of denial of dignity in death and apathy of the system which even the dead ones voted to keep in place.\",\n",

While UAE and China are still orbiting, Nasa landed its rover on the surface to deepen its understanding of the planet as its SUV-sized rover drills onto the surface.\\n\\nNow a geneticist says there might be chances that some microbes might have hitchhiked their way on to the neighbouring planet.\\n\\nEarth has sent around 30 spacecraft and landers to the Red Planet, but did something else made the journey as well? Christopher Mason, a professor of genomics, physiology, and biophysics at Weill Cornell Medicine, Cornell University is asking this question.\\n\\nIn a recent report published in BBC Future the geneticist asks, \"Could a trace bacterium or spore from Earth have accidentally been carried into space and survived the trip to make its new home on Mars?\"\\n\\nMason takes evidence from the microbes that evolved on the International Space Station. Four strains of Methylobacteriaceae were isolated from the Space Station from different locations over two flights. Of these three were identified as \"gram-negative, rod-shaped, catalase-positive, oxidase-positive, motile bacteria,\" while the fourth was identified as Methylorubrum rhodesianum. Methylorubrum rhodesianum is a strain of bacteria identified as a contaminant of DNA extraction kit reagents.\\n\\nDetrimental to research\\n\\nIf a microbe hitchhikes its way onboard the rovers on to the Martian surface, it could adulterate the data sets the scientists are receiving and could put in question the discovery of life on another planet, which has been one of the sole objectives of several missions sent across planets. \"Scientists need to be sure that any discovery of life on another planet is genuinely native there, rather than a false identification of an alien-looking, but Earth-grown, contamination,\" Mason said in the report.\\n\\nApart from misguiding the research, these microbes could be of more concern to astronauts travelling to the Red Planet in the future posing a risk to their health as well as equipment being used to support their stay in the terrible Martian atmosphere. Mason suspects that there could already be traces of human DNA on the planet as \"ever since the first two Soviet probes landed on the Martian surface in 1971, followed by the US Viking 1 lander in 1976, there likely have been some fragments of microbial, and maybe human DNA, on Mars. Given the global dust storms and trace amounts of DNA that might have gone with these spacecraft, we have to be sure we don\\'t fool ourselves that the life we find isn\\'t originally from Earth.\"\\n\\nImpossible to achieve zero biomass\\n\\nNasa builds its spacecraft, probes, landers, rovers in cleanrooms to ensure no microbes or other impurities creep into delicate equipment and adulterate the data that it relays back. The spacecraft is designed in ISO-5 clean rooms, where ISO-1 denotes cleanest facilities and ISO-9 are least clean. Strict protocols are ensured to keep impurities out and that \"only a few hundred particles can contaminate each square foot.\" However, Mason claims that it is almost impossible to get to zero biomass and with microbes present everywhere around us there are chances some might sneak there into the cleanest of rooms.\\n\\n\"In JPL\\'s clean rooms, we found evidence of microbes that have the potential to be problematic during space missions.

              " 'El proyecto de la elaboración de carbonato de litio y su posterior industrialización mediante la fabricación de baterías, comenzó en mayo de 2008. Postergadas las metas del proyecto repetidas veces, se llegó a la escala piloto, pero como indiqué en varios artículos, hasta ahora no se ha vendido ni una sola tonelada de carbonato de litio grado batería (Li2CO3 GB), con pureza de 99,5% o más, imprescindible para fabricar baterías. En varios artículos publicados desde hace años, indiqué también que el método de concentración por evaporación solar no era el adecuado, por la insuficiente evaporación debido a la intensificación de las lluvias, así como tampoco la extracción de litio, por la exagerada relación de magnesio/litio (Mg/Li) de 19/1 en el salar de Uyuni. Sugerí el cambio de método y surgió el de la extracción directa del litio (EDL), pero no se hizo nada. Es más, se está construyendo la planta industrial de Li2CO3 GB, condenada al fracaso por lo explicado, que debió arrancar en 2019.\\n\\nSe estima que hasta la puesta en marcha de las plantas industriales de Li2CO3 GB y de Cloruro de Potasio (KCl), que funciona desde 2018 produciendo menos del 10% de lo proyectado (por lo que está operando con grandes pérdidas), se habría gastado unos 1.000 millones de dólares (M$us).\\n\\nEl 28/08/20 Teague Egan fundador y director ejecutivo de EnergyX, indicó que Bolivia está al borde de un boom revolucionario, que después de años de oportunidades perdidas, el aspirante presidencial boliviano Luis Arce reconoce que el recurso nacional más rico de la nación, el litio, será la clave para crear un poder económico fuerte. que “Arce ha anunciado planes, a través de la firma global de asesoría en minerales Benchmark Intelligence, integrar el litio en la agenda central de la economía del país”. En el comunicado emitido por Benchmark, se cita a Arce diciendo: “Bajo la presidencia de Luis Arce, Bolivia se asociará con empresas líderes en el mundo para aprovechar el valor de nuestros abundantes recursos de litio para crear empleos y mejorar el bienestar económico de todos los bolivianos”. Continúa indicando que se debe seguir algunos pasos como completar una evaluación completa de los recursos de litio, invitar a empresas líderes a participar en la licitación para el desarrollo industrial del litio.\\n\\nLa Agencia EFE el 30/04/21 indicó “El Gobierno de Luis Arce lanzó una convocatoria internacional para que empresas interesadas puedan probar en Bolivia su tecnología de EDL”. La convocatoria se presentó en un seminario en La Paz con la participación del presidente Arce y el ministro de Hidrocarburos y Energías, Franklin Molina, además de representantes de empresas de Rusia, China y Estados Unidos que expusieron las características generales de esta tecnología. El ministro explicó que se separa el litio “de iones de potasio, sodio, calcio, magnesio y sulfatos, los cuales se encuentran en una solución en la salmuera”. Destacó que la aplicación de esta tecnología dará “mayor productividad en la producción de carbonato de litio y otros derivados”.\\n\\nEsto significa un reconocimiento del fracaso del método de evaporación solar en la concentración y extracción del litio, en que se gastó mucho dinero. La aplicación del proceso EDL significa que éste proveería la sal de litio (seguramente cloruro de litio), de la calidad necesaria para que la planta industrial una vez acabada, pueda producir anualmente 15.000 toneladas de Li2CO3 GB. Las costosas piscinas de evaporación solar se las usaría solo para producir KCL y otras sales, lo que aumentará sobremanera su costo de producción. Es urgente realizar una auditoría técnico-económica de la planta industrial de KCl, para determinar si se justifica su funcionamiento. El proceso EDL tendría además las ventajas de no tener que recurrir a la utilización de grandes cantidades de cal para precipitar el Mg, lo que hubiera significado altos costos y un fuerte daño ambiental.\\n\\nLa Ley No 535 (Ley de Minería) en su Artículo 26 numeral IV indica “Se declara al Litio y al Potasio como elementos estratégicos cuyo desarrollo se realizará por empresas públicas mineras de acuerdo con el Artículo 73 de la presente Ley”. El Art. 73 numeral I. indica que Comibol es responsable de todo el ciclo productivo, industrialización y comercialización de los recursos evaporíticos. La Gerencia Nacional de Recursos Evaporíticos (GNRE), dependiente de Comibol se hizo cargo del proyecto. Mediante Ley No 928 de 27/04/17, con las mismas atribuciones de la GNRE se creó Yacimientos de Litio Bolivianos (YLB) dependiente del Ministerio de Energías, creado por el DS No 3.058 de 24/01/17. Se indicó siempre que la inversión extranjera solo podía intervenir en el proceso de industrialización (fabricación de baterías de litio). Lo anterior significa que la empresa que gane la licitación no puede operar el proceso EDL, porque es parte del desarrollo de la producción de Li2CO3 GB, o sea que solo podrá vender su tecnología, a no ser que se cambie la Ley 535.\\n\\nRESERVAS PROBADAS DE LITIO\\n\\nOtro problema fundamental es que hasta ahora no tenemos reservas probadas de litio en volumen y contenido, que es por donde empieza todo proyecto de extracción de recursos mineros. En 1989 la francesa ORSTOM y la UMSA determinaron recursos (solo hicieron 67 perforaciones en todo el salar) de 8,9 millones de toneladas (Mt) de litio con 0,044% Li (el salar de Atacama tiene un contenido aproximado de 0,15% Li). Sin suficiente respaldo técnico, capciosamente la ex GNRE en 2010 indicó tener una reserva de al menos 100 Mt de litio y en 2019 la Agencia Boliviana de Información citando a una alta autoridad, indicó que la empresa americana SRK certificó una reserva de 21 Mt de litio, la mayor reserva del mundo. En ambos casos no se indicó el contenido de litio. El Servicio Geológico de Estados Unidos en su prestigiosa publicación anual sobre minerales consigna un recurso (no reserva) de 21 Mt Li para Bolivia en 2019. Es urgente contar con reservas probadas de litio para saber su volumen y especialmente su contenido, que es fundamental para determinar la economía operativa. ¿Cómo sabremos que los costos de operación incluido el de la EDL darán margen de utilidad dependiendo del contenido y el precio del litio? Las diferentes zonas del salar tienen distintas concentraciones. Las más ricas, de acuerdo con ORSTOM-UMSA están en la desembocadura del río Grande, que tiene un área de 400 km2 (donde están ubicadas las piscinas), el 4% del área del salar de 10.000 km2. Las reservas que se desarrollen seguramente estarán más próximas a los recursos señalados por ORSTOM-UMSA,\\n\\nSolamente comparando contenidos de los salares Atacama y Uyuni, puede decirse que, en igualdad de condiciones operativas, en Uyuni los costos de operación serán 0,15/0,044 =3,4 veces más que en Atacama. En suma, tenemos un litio de baja calidad por su baja ley y alto contenido de impurezas. Es el único proyecto estatal de litio en el mundo y seguramente el único que arrancó sin tener reservas probadas.\\n\\nPUBLICIDAD',\n",

El gobierno francés hacia pruebas nucleares en Mururoa, un atolón (isla coralina) en el archipiélago de Tuamotu en la polinesia francesa, donde la potencia europea ejecutó más de 160 pruebas de bombas atómicas, convirtiéndolo en un lugar inhabitable.\\n\\nEl 9 de mayo de 1973, Nueva Zelandia solicito a la Corte que ordene al gobierno francés no realizar más pruebas nucleares en el Pacífico Sur. El 22 de junio de ese mismo año la Corte Internacional de Justicia emitió una resolución en el sentido que el “gobierno francés debe evitar las pruebas nucleares, porque producen lluvia radioactiva en territorio de Nueva Zelandia”.\\n\\nA pesar del fallo de los jueces de la CIJ, Francia, que es miembro del Consejo de Seguridad de las Naciones Unidas, llevó 5 pruebas nucleares más entre julio y agosto de 1973 y otras 7 entre junio y septiembre de 1974. Y a pesar de la desobediencia, Francia no fue sancionada y se esgrimió la seguridad nacional como argumento para el desacato.\\n\\nEl caso de la Argentina y Chile\\n\\nEn 1977 la CIJ dictaminó que las islas en el Canal de Beagle pertenecían a Chile y no a la Argentina. El gobierno argentino rechazó la sentencia y casi se genera un enfrentamiento militar y gracias a la mediación del Papa, fue finalmente evitado.\\n\\nPUBLICIDAD\\n\\nINAPLICABILIDAD DE LOS\\n\\nFALLOS DE LA CORTE\\n\\nCaso Colombia\\n\\nEn noviembre de 2012, la Corte Internacional de Justicia concedió a Nicaragua 75 mil kilómetros cuadrados en el mar caribe que estaban en poder de Colombia, sin embargo, un año después del fallo de la Corte, en 2013, el presidente de Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, aseguró que la sentencia no es aplicable y planteó que solo un tratado de límites con Nicaragua podría solucionar el problema.

Nigeria rechazó y desacató en 2002 la decisión de la Corte que le otorgó la Peninsula de Bakassi a Camerún, sin embargo, tiempo después Nigeria acabó por entregar el territorio rico en reservas naturales de petróleo.\\n\\nIslandia\\n\\nEn julio de 1972 Islandia amplia de forma unilateral el área de pesca de 12 a 50 millas, lo que provocó que el Reino Unido y Alemania hagan su reclamo ante la Corte. Islandia no aceptó la jurisdicción de la Corte y no participó en ninguna de las audiencias. En julio de 1974 la Corte determinó que el área de pesca de Islandia no era válida. Islandia no acató el fallo. En 1976 concluyó el conflicto con un acuerdo que concedió a Islandia casi la totalidad de sus demandas. A pesar de estos desacatos no hubo sanción alguna para Islandia.\\n\\nEstados Unidos\\n\\nNicaragua denuncia a EEUU en 1984 ante la Corte, por el uso ilegal de la fuerza por la intervención norteamericana.

Alemania solicitó la suspensión de la ejecución y la Corte pidió a Estados Unidos que La Grand no sea ejecutado, mientras espera la decisión final del proceso. La Grand fue ejecutado y en el 2001 la Corte Internacional de Justicia determinó que EEUU violó la Convención de Viena.

Probablemente esta podría ser una afirmación menos cuestionable desde la teoría política, evitando soslayar que es, al mismo tiempo, la encargada de proporcionar a la sociedad múltiples teorías desarrolladas que sugieren una gama amplia de mecanismos y soluciones alternativas a cuestiones relativas a la vigencia y el acceso a la justicia.\\n\\nPenosamente, advertimos que tales ideales se han convertido en quimeras lejanas e inalcanzables, pues ella está minada por la injerencia de un poder político que no ha dudado en socavar su naturaleza y espíritu que, otrora, confería sentido y razón de su existencia, arrastrándola inexorablemente hacia la degradación y anomia flagrante.

But I shouldn’t take this as pressure and not think of anything that affects my mind. I don’t know if I will win a medal but I will keep no stone unturned in my effort.

              " 'It is very likely that your phone will be the first thing the police will take into their custody should you find yourself caught in an unwelcome situation. Police in several countries have gained access to some advanced tools that help them pry into a locked smartphone for data. While tech companies do not advocate cracking tools, the need for them has led to the growth of digital forensics to understand more about a convict. But given the nature of technology, it may be prone to tampering. And to do away with it potentially, a researcher has developed an app that obstructs the use of such tools and deletes data on your phone.\\n\\nLockUp is a new app that Matt Bergin, a senior researcher with security firm KoreLogic, has developed. Bergin showed off his work at last week’s Black Hat Asia cybersecurity conference. The programme inside the new app is meant to thwart digital forensics apps such as Cellebrite from gaining access to a locked smartphone and snooping on the data saved into it. Bergin, however, has said that LockUp is not meant to become a hurdle in legal proceedings, including the use of data extraction tools, against a criminal. “The idea behind LockUp isn’t so much to create a safe haven for criminals,” the researcher told Gizmodo.\\n\\nBergin explained that the idea behind LockUp is to unearth and prove that forensics software that police are using to extract data from super-secure devices such as an iPhone is not that secure itself. The researcher has claimed that even Cellebrite, which is one of the widely-used tools for data extraction, is full of issues. And much like Cellebrite, there are several other types of forensics software that can be tricked into doing something “that you might not expect it to be able to do.”\\n\\nCellebrite was at the centre of the study that led to the creation of the LockUp app. This Israeli software has often faced criticism for its high level of snooping on secure mobile platforms. Bergin’s analysis of the Cellebrite app is very similar to the blog post that Signal CEO Moxie Marlinspike wrote last month. Marlinspike vividly explained how the data that Cellebrite’s tools extract can be manipulated, leading to the fudging of evidence. Cellebrite is the biggest supplier of forensics software to the governments of different countries, and since the data from their tools is deemed reliable in court cases, the authenticity of the data raises some big questions.\\n\\nAnd while there may still be a long time before Cellebrite intends to come up with a solution to evidence tampering, LockUp is shouldering the responsibility to quash any such attempts, software such as one by Cellebrite may be able to do. According to Bergin, LockUp gets attentive whenever a new programme is downloaded to a user’s phone. The app then begins to scour the entire ecosystem for hashes, suspicious files, and the “certificate metadata associated with the application.” And in case the search results in nothing, LockUp will perform a programmatic factory reset of the phone in an attempt to weed out this application. This is similar to how your iPhone deletes all the data from your phone after several failed attempts at unlocking are made, given the settings for this functionality are turned on.\\n\\nBergin’s new app LockUp, however, is not readily available to download from Google Play Store. It is all just a set of codes right now that Berging has uploaded to Github. So, in case you know about app development, you can use the codes and pack them into an APK file that can also be published on Google Play Store for Android phones. But Bergin thinks his new app should have a far greater purpose. The forensics software making companies, such as Cellebrite, should adopt testing procedures before finalising their data extraction tools because the data they fetch can be used in courts. Cellebrite and some other companies that are into making digital forensics software do not follow any regulations or security standards because there are none. LockUp wants to be an alternative to them, at least.',\n",

La magnitud de esta situación reduce la capacidad de estos países de movilizar los recursos fiscales necesarios para apuntalar la economía durante una crisis, llevar a cabo políticas macroeconómicas eficaces y generar capital humano para el desarrollo a largo plazo, señala una nota de prensa de la entidad internacional.\\n\\nDe acuerdo con declaraciones de empresarios y economistas, en Bolivia la informalidad casi está por el 80 %, debido a que cuando se habla de aumento salarial, solo beneficia a un sector de la población, que llega a 20 %, y la pandemia empujó a empresas y trabajadores a salir de la formalidad por los costos operativos.\\n\\nExistieron planteamientos para que se flexibilicen las normas tributarias así como implementar incentivos para que la informalidad se reduzca, y que haya más empresas en el lado formal.\\n\\nLa pandemia provocó cierre de empresas y despidos, que aún no se recuperan, y empujó a gran parte de la población a dedicarse al comercio informal, y una muestra de ello es el crecimiento de ferias barriales.\\n\\nSegún un nuevo estudio del Grupo Banco Mundial, un porcentaje sorprendentemente elevado de trabajadores y empresas de las economías de mercados emergentes y en desarrollo (EMED) opera fuera del campo visual de los Gobiernos, lo que supone un desafío que probablemente frenará la recuperación de estas economías, a menos que los Gobiernos adopten un conjunto integral de políticas que permitan abordar los problemas de la economía informal.\\n\\nEn las economías que registran un alto grado de informalidad, los recursos públicos para combatir las recesiones profundas y apoyar la recuperación posterior son más limitados que en otras economías. En las EMED donde los niveles de informalidad son superiores a la media, los ingresos públicos representaron, en total, aproximadamente el 20 % del PIB, entre 5 y 12 puntos porcentuales por debajo del nivel de otras EMED. El gasto público también se redujo hasta en 10 puntos porcentuales del PIB. Asimismo, la capacidad de los bancos centrales para apoyar a las economías se ve limitada por los sistemas financieros subdesarrollados asociados a la informalidad generalizada, apunta la nota.\\n\\n“Los trabajadores informales son predominantemente mujeres y jóvenes poco calificados. En medio de la crisis provocada por la Covid-19, a menudo quedan rezagados y tienen un acceso limitado a las redes de seguridad social cuando pierden el empleo o sufren graves pérdidas de ingresos”, señaló Mari Pangestu, directora gerente de Políticas de Desarrollo y Alianzas del Banco Mundial.\\n\\n“Este análisis contribuirá a llenar las lagunas de conocimiento en un ámbito poco estudiado y a que las autoridades sigan adoptando medidas para combatir la informalidad, lo que será imprescindible en el futuro para lograr un desarrollo ecológico, resiliente e inclusivo”, reflexionó.\\n\\nPUBLICIDAD',\n",

Formada en Diseño, video, animación, accionismo y curaduría, en 2014 ganó el 2º Premio del Concurso Nacional Arte Joven ExpresArte de Aecid con una Intervención Urbana llamada “Memorias de la tierra” un dibujo en el terreno del mega deslizamiento en Kupini. Con un recorrido impresionante, en esta exclusiva conocemos más de Aldair y su nueva exposición.\\n\\n¿Quién es Aldair Indra?\\n\\nArtista Visual, Diseñadora Gráfica, estudiante de Sociología. Nacida en La Paz, Bolivia. Una mujer que se identifica con el arquetipo del guerrero. El fuego de transmutación es un símbolo presente en varias de mis obras.\\n\\nPUBLICIDAD\\n\\n¿Recuerdas ese momento exacto en que tuviste tu primer acercamiento al arte?\\n\\nLos recuerdos son bastante tempranos ya que en mi familia se apreciaba y estudiaba mucho la literatura, el arte y por otro lado las corrientes filosóficas y distintas espiritualidades, aunque más de oriente que de nuestro país. Ya de pequeña me gustaba pintar y dibujar. Incluso me interesaba mucho la biografía de artistas modernos y ya de mayor los de nuestro país, me preguntaba cómo le hacían, por qué sus obras eran “tan raras”.\\n\\n¿Qué quieres expresar mediante tu arte?\\n\\nUna búsqueda de la espiritualidad, una búsqueda de la sanación del ser humano que está inmerso en esta sociedad enferma. La necesidad de curar la huella colonial que es una herida actual, presente en cada centímetro del país, en cada gesto, en cada relación social, esta herida enferma el alma colectiva. Así también contrastar los grandes sistemas de conocimiento, el pensamiento mágico y el razonamiento científico que dan razón a la cosmovisión del mundo.\\n\\nPUBLICIDAD\\n\\n¿Cómo catalogarías tu paso por tierras chilenas?\\n\\nRealmente fue una estadía muy productiva, el motivo específico fue la residencia arte + astronomía del Festival Saco Semana de Arte Contemporáneo de Antofagasta. Sin embargo hace años que participo en proyectos colectivos de artistas chilenos que vienen a Bolivia o artistas bolivianos que fuimos invitados a exponer en sus curadurías, como la BIenal de Artes Mediales de Santiago, La Galería Temporal, y la Galería Cima, entre muchos y en varias ciudades.\\n\\n¿Cuál ha sido el mayor aporte a tu carrera este paso por Chile?\\n\\nCreo que profundizar la cuestión dicotómica entre ciencia y creencias locales, como la astronomía y cosmovisión andina. A nivel general, comprender los problemáticas comunes al continente, compartimos la misma historia, mismas herencias culturales y desafíos a futuro y en cuanto al arte: desarrollo de los medios y preocupaciones conceptuales. En el aspecto formal, un mayor acercamiento a las artes mediales, al uso de tecnologías en relación proporcional a la poética que uno desea expresar.\\n\\n¿Dónde ha sido la expo individual más representativa para ti a nivel profesional?\\n\\nSiempre se cree que tu última producción es la más exhaustiva, uno va mejorando y concretando su expresión de mejores maneras, en una anterior etapa relacionada a las cosmovisiones, la exposición “Cosmos” en Kiosko Galería en 2019:\\n\\nLa búsqueda de comunión de un ser humano con el cosmos transita por antiguos sitios de observación astronómica, mediante intervenciones, videos y objetos de arqueología futura.\\n\\nLa pieza central es “Disco Solar” un Fake Documental que relata el lanzamiento de la NASA del Disco Voyager al espacio en 1977, el cual contenía información sobre el planeta tierra enviado para que un ente interespacial lo intercepte; sin embargo, como un bucle en el tiempo, vuelve a 1492 cuando, según la historia oral urbana, el Sacerdote Inca Aramu Muru escapó a través de la puerta de Juli (Perú) con el disco dorado, un amuleto de comunicación espiritual, para salvarlo de la conquista. Según los comunarios, esta es una puerta interestelar.\\n\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/1191557151004804/\\n\\n¿Por qué el nombre de tu nueva exposición “Lo Espiritual es Político”?\\n\\nSe considera lo político como un terreno de graves enfrentamientos ideológicos del ser humano en el orden público, en oposición a lo espiritual que se consideran credos y desarrollo del aspecto interior del ser humano. En los dos últimos años en nuestro contexto hemos vivido enfrentamientos profundos donde salieron a la luz profundas heridas del pasado, el inconsciente colectivo que continúan manifestándose, la huella colonial, es una herida heredada con rasgos que se accionan en cada aspecto de nuestro diario vivir, en cada gesto, considerando que es desde el terreno de lo ancestral del alma, que se determina nuestra relación con el entorno, con el cosmos, determina nuestra relación con el mundo y nuestro entorno sociopolítico. Considerando que una de las armas de la colonización fue la evangelización, liquidación de las creencias locales, las cuales persisten con todo su desarrollo filosófico, el sistema de creencias que uno elige vivir determina tu ética frente a la vida, lo cual en su conjunto aflora en el tejido social que hoy en día convivimos.\\n\\n¿Qué factores te inspiraron para las obras de esta nueva presentación?\\n\\nEsta muestra es un proceso específico desarrollado desde el problema de los incendios en la chiquitanía, a partir de ese entonces se vivieron convulsiones sociales en nuestro país y alrededores, problemas socio-políticos que hicieron aflorar problemas enraizados en nuestra sociedad como la colonización interna, el racismo, la explotación de unos a otros en beneficio del poder, una democracia secuestrada que favorece a unos pocos. La primera instalación de esta serie es Manifiesto de luz, se realizó en Galería CIMA de Santiago, que ahora queda en el epicentro de las protestas en la plaza Dignidad, esta obra fue como un ritual de re conexión entre la tierra y el cielo: una instalación de luces láser astronómicos que se pierden con luz infinita en el cielo, generando un tejido de luz, y sahumerio de plantas medicinales del lugar. En código morse escribimos la palabra “Origen”, a una semana de esa presentación, comenzaron las protestas en Chile y los problemas de democracia en Bolivia. Todo el año de protestas allí, se usaron láseres astronómicos como armas de confrontación de larga distancia para defenderse de las represiones, esta es una relación a posteriori, sin embargo, importante para quienes lo vivieron. Esta instalación está ahora en ‘Persona’. Luego de ello a lo largo de estos 2 años se produjo varias piezas que presenté online, que aludían a imágenes icónicas que conforman “el ser nacional”, como el Palacio Quemado, el Himno Nacional distorsionado, (diseño sonoro de Ricardo Inofuentes), la Wiphala que presento: negra, de luto; ciertos elementos icónicos de la cultura local como el sahumerio, la k’oa, la lectura del destino mediante la hoja de coca, la chakana, los rituales con fuego como limpia, transmutación, el choque cultural entre aymara y español, y otras imágenes que encontrarán en la exposición. A lo largo de mi carrera, todo objeto se presenta con una intención ritual, mediante el fuego transmutador, y otros elementos de la naturaleza que tienen una carga energética y relacionada a la magia, a la sanación. En conjunto, la exposición es un acto ritual de sanación de los problemas sociopolíticos de nuestro país, una milluch’ada a la fachada del palacio de gobierno, una k’oa para el estado anímico del ciudadano, actos psicomágicos en contra de la explotación y colonización de los seres vivos.\\n\\n¿Qué ha sido lo más difícil de ultimar detalles en tiempo de pandemia?\\n\\nHemos vivido tiempos delicados a nivel de paz mental, lamentablemente en febrero, sufrimos la pérdida por razones de salud de Fhernando Loayza, compañero de vida y colaborador de Galo en la galería, le tenemos presente y desde ese entonces las actividades de la galería son en su homenaje. Fue por ello que decidimos seguir adelante, aportando con arte al desarrollo del ser humano, como es nuestro sentir, de frente a la sociedad.\\n\\nEn cuanto al trabajo en sí de montaje ha sido un poco más dilatado conseguir algunos materiales porque nadie está disponible a tiempo completo. Estos días de visita como hemos recomendado exhaustivamente la distancia social hemos tenido la cantidad suficiente de visitantes, pese al cuantioso apoyo a distancia. De parte de Galo, la intención es continuar con el calendario de la galería a continuación de esta exhibición.\\n\\n¿Dónde podemos apreciarla y hasta cuándo estará?\\n\\nEn ‘Persona Casa Galería’, bajo la dirección impecable del curador, artista, arquitecto y diseñador boliviano Galo Coca Soto.\\n\\nSe encuentra en la zona de Sopocachi, calle Alfredo Ascarrunz #2592 de martes a sábado de 16.00 a 21.00 y estará hasta el 18 de junio.

In its wake, MEE finds a traumatised place littered with mass graves\\n\\nTARHUNA, Libya - At the Haruda family’s farm, agricultural labourers have been replaced with forensic teams, their bright white protective suits silhouetted against dusty, rust-coloured soil. Areas for excavation have been marked out in chalk, like macabre football pitches. Little triangular flags beside shallow potholes indicate each place bodies have been found.\\n\\nTarhuna, a rural town 60km southeast of Tripoli, where olive trees stripe low hills rising out of Libya’s coastal plain, is searching for its dead.\\n\\nBlood and decomposed tissue left in a mass grave in Tarhuna (Supplied)\\n\\nAlmost 80 corpses have been pulled from the ground in two and a half months, 56 in the Haruda farm alone. Officials believe three times that number could still lie under Tarhuna’s fields and orchards.\\n\\n“We still have a lot to dig. Just 20 percent of this area has been excavated,” says Mohammed Ali al-Kosher, the town’s mayor.\\n\\n“People of all backgrounds were killed and buried here, including a 10-year-old child. We’re finding new bodies every day. One man was even buried with his car, his hands tied to the steering wheel.”\\n\\n\\'People of all backgrounds were killed and buried here, including a 10-year-old child. We’re finding new bodies every day\\' - Mohammed Ali al-Kosher, mayor\\n\\nThe teams searching for corpses look for tell-tale signs – a chemical change in the soil, mounds of earth piled up nearby, lingering smells.\\n\\nIn two graves from which bodies were retrieved the day before, blood and decomposed tissue has fossilised the victims’ outline in the earth. Forensic teams sieve the soil, finding fragments of bone and clumps of hair. The stench remains.\\n\\nTarhuna is traumatised, with emotional scars running far deeper than the crevices carved into the ground in the search for victims.\\n\\nFor 14 months this town of 40,000, whose fertile lands were once prized by Italian colonisers and favoured by Muammar Gaddafi, was transformed into a military base from which eastern commander Khalifa Haftar launched his ill-fated assault on Tripoli.\\n\\nHundreds of civilians were killed in the fighting around the Libyan capital between April 2019 and June 2020, but in Tarhuna people were disappeared for the smallest of infractions or suspicions of allegiance.\\n\\nWhen Tarhuna was taken on 5 June by forces loyal to the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA), they discovered 106 bodies stacked up in the local hospital’s morgue. Quickly, authorities realised the town held several mass graves, too. The Haruda farm is the largest of eight found so far, with search teams believing that number could rise to 12.\\n\\nKosher, who the GNA placed in charge of a temporary steering municipality after taking the town, says it will take at least a year to excavate all the suspected sites, particularly without better equipment and international support. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for a “transparent investigation”, but so far little assistance has been forthcoming.\\n\\n“From a religious point of view, this is not a decent burial. This is what Daesh does, these are the actions of people who desecrate Islam,” Kosher says, staring into a pit where 11 bodies were recently retrieved.\\n\\n“The killings were a message: even opposing the fighting in Tripoli can lead to death. This was all done with the blessing of Haftar and his allies.”\\n\\nTarhuna: Haftar\\'s launchpad\\n\\nFor five years, Tarhuna was ruled by a family of bloodthirsty brothers, the Kanis, and their eponymous Kaniyat militia, also known as the 7th Brigade.\\n\\nEssentially mobsters, who in the tumult of post-Gaddafi Libya carved out a fiefdom in this western town, the Kani family momentarily gained geopolitical significance early last year, when Haftar sought to use their territory as a launchpad for his assault on the Libyan capital.\\n\\nHaftar, a UAE, Egypt and Russia-backed warlord who commands a collection of militias known as the Libyan National Army (LNA), had long eyed Tripoli.\\n\\nTo his surprise, however, armed groups from Tripoli and Misrata rallied around the UN-recognised GNA with potency, and his offensive bogged down in the capital’s outskirts.\\n\\nAs the conflict progressed, Turkey poured drones, equipment and Syrian mercenaries into Libya, swinging the fighting decisively in the GNA’s favour until the LNA melted away in June this year.\\n\\nDuring those 14 months, when Tarhuna was awash with LNA battalions and foreign mercenaries, Haftar’s Kaniyat allies became increasingly suspicious of the population they repressed, with disastrous consequences for the town’s residents.\\n\\nParanoia and conflict industrialised the Kanis’ murderous tendencies. Crackdowns on dissent - both real and imagined - became daily occurrences. Whole families disappeared at a whim.\\n\\nToday, mementos of murder can be found in almost every neighbourhood, every farm.\\n\\nNear a construction site yet to be probed for bodies lies a fridge, its inside caked in dried blood.\\n\\nElsewhere, a battered white car riddled with bulletholes has ploughed into some trees. To the side, two black shoes, a pair of high heels and a knot of hair in the mud are all that remain of its passengers.\\n\\nTarhuna’s now-bustling junctions were once the scenes of Kaniyat checkpoints, where LNA militiamen arbitrarily pulled men out of their cars for perceived infractions, never to be seen again.\\n\\nMayor Mohammed Ali al-Kosher points at bulletholes in an abandoned car (MEE/Daniel Hilton)\\n\\nOne road by an open field, known as the “triangle of death”, was a favoured place for summary executions. Neighbourhoods on three sides could witness the killings.\\n\\nMost of those found in the hospital have been identified, including children. But of those being pulled from the ground, just a couple, including a man in his 60s found dumped in a well, have been named.\\n\\nThe sheer volume of horror stories Tarhunis have to share is overwhelming: casual conversation can reveal a resident is missing several brothers, cousins or uncles. Hundreds of children now have no fathers.\\n\\nThere is palpable relief that the LNA and Kaniyat have gone, but suspicion - both of fellow Tarhunis and state institutions in general - is widespread.\\n\\nAccording to the Tripoli-based General Authority of Search and Identification of Missing Persons, some 270 people are reported lost in Tarhuna. But D Mohamad Ziltny, its international cooperation manager, estimates 150 more have yet to be reported, with fear of reprisals still hanging over the town.\\n\\nThough the Kanis fled in June, their menace remains.\\n\\nResidents complain of phone calls from the brothers, threatening retribution if their crimes are exposed and promising a return from exile in Libya’s Haftar-held east.\\n\\nRule of the Kani brothers\\n\\nAt first glance, Mohammed al-Kani does not resemble a warlord. The eldest, quietest, best educated of the seven brothers, he was the only Kani to hold down relatively well-paying jobs, in the security services and the state oil company.\\n\\nBehind that calm veneer, however, was a ruthlessness and unpredictability. Supplicants could be as likely killed as have their requests accepted.\\n\\n“He was the thinker. He came to be like a sheikh. Like Al Pacino in the Godfather, Mohammed was always thinking, as opposed to necessarily getting his hands dirty,” Jalel Harchaoui, an analyst and expert on Tarhuna, tells MEE.\\n\\nTarhuna timeline: 2011 - 2020 + Show - Hide How a town of 40,000 people became pivotal in the Libyan conflict: 2011: A Nato-backed uprising against Muammar Gaddafi topples the longtime autocrat, who is killed in October. 2012: Ali al-Kani, the only Kani brother to rebel against Gaddafi, is murdered on the road to Tajoura by a group of men, including some from the rival Naaja family. Mohammed al-Kani, who is in Saudi Arabia for Hajj, orders no action to be taken until he is back. Mohammed’s return to Tarhuna is followed by a string of murders and lynchings. One man suspected of killing his brother is paraded in a central square. The reprisals are the start of the Kanis’ ascent. 2014: Libya is divided by a new civil war. The Kani clan back the Tripoli-based Libya Dawn administration and reject Haftar’s offensive against Islamists and militants in Benghazi. 2015: The Kanis have full control over Tarhuna. They now control a force of 4,000 men known as the Kaniyat, or 7th Brigade, absorbing local security services. 2017: Millions of migrants and refugees passing through Libya en route to Europe prompt the Kani to set up an anti-smuggling operation. 2018: The Kanis agree deals with rivals in Misrata and Zintan, before launching an assault on Tripoli. The Kaniyat attacks the Libyan capital, claiming it is doing so to stop corruption and embezzlement, although in reality it wants funds and influence. To the Kanis’ chagrin, the Mistrans largely stay out of the conflict: the assault ultimately backfires and costs more than 100 deaths. 2019: Haftar allies with the Kanis: the Kaniyat become the 9th Brigade of his Libyan National Army (LNA). In April, the LNA assault Tripoli from Tarhuna and Gharyan. Despite believing the conflict would last weeks, the offensive drags on. In September Mohsen al-Kani is killed alongside younger brother Abdul Azim. The Government of National Accord (GNA) counterattacks Tarhuna in October and December, exposing LNA weaknesses. In retaliation the Kaniyat take out reprisals on the Tarhuna\\'s residents. 2020: In late May the LNA is struggling to hold its positions around Tripoli, and pro-Haftar Wagner Group Russian mercenaries retreat from the frontline. As LNA fighters begin to retreat, the Kaniyat fire on them in an attempt to stop the collapse. GNA forces capture Tarhuna in early June. The Kanis and Kaniyat flee east.\\n\\n“The other brothers were more into physical action, whilst Mohammed was the brains behind the operation. If you walk away from a conversation with Mohammed, you don’t walk away with the impression that you just spoke with a gangster, with hundreds of corpses beneath his feet.”\\n\\nBeside him was Mohsen, a headstrong military man who headed Kaniyat assaults on Tripoli, both during Haftar’s offensive and in summer 2018, when the Kanis attacked the capital in a quarrel over state revenues.\\n\\nDemanding, independent and contemptuous of his LNA colleagues, Mohsen proved a headache for Haftar, taking the warlord’s weapons but refusing his orders.\\n\\nThat tension has contributed to suggestions that his September 2019 killing, the circumstances around which remain murky, was facilitated in part by LNA elements. His death, alongside a younger brother, was met among the Kaniyat with a howl of rage that saw dozens of detainees executed in retribution.\\n\\nThe man leading the crackdown at home was Abdul-Rahim al-Kani, whose role in Tarhuna is likened by Hachoui as heading the mukhabarat, or secret police.\\n\\nA shaven-headed enforcer, Abdul-Rahim’s task was to maintain the Kanis’ increasingly unsure position in Tarhuna as the Tripoli offensive dragged on.\\n\\nA combination of photos showing Mohammed, Mohsen and Abdul-Rahim al-Kani (Social media)\\n\\nThe Kanis drew their wealth from multiple sources: a cement factory, agricultural assets, skimming money transferred by Tripoli to the municipality. They also enforced a protection racket, practiced extortion and ransomed people seized almost at random.\\n\\nBut like the mafia they were, the Kani also played the role of benefactors, handing out favours and endowments to Tarhuna residents struggling in Libya’s collapsed economy.\\n\\nBetween 2015 and the moment it joined the LNA, the Kaniyat held a firm grip on Tarhuna, wrested violently from its rivals and maintained through occasional purges. Until Haftar’s offensive, its strict rule provided the town with a modicum of stability.\\n\\n“If you’re in Libya in 2015, you look around and it’s just a nightmare everywhere you look. Tripoli was very dangerous, you had Daesh in Sirte and Daesh in Sabratha, corpses on the beaches of Zuwara, it was just horrible everywhere,” Harchaoui says.\\n\\n“And Tarhuna was very pleasant. It was quiet, it was very safe - you know, how North Korea is very safe.”\\n\\nThe Kanis bet that backing Haftar would only increase their wealth and status. It was a bet they lost.\\n\\n\\'It could not end well\\'\\n\\nBy 13 November 2019, things were not going well for Haftar or the Kanis.\\n\\nMohsen was dead, Gharyan, the LNA’s other supply line to the Tripoli front, had been retaken by the GNA, and a daring attack on Tarhuna’s al-Dawoon neighbourhood the month before had shown that the Kaniyat were vulnerable.\\n\\nDisappearances were increasing, so when Ahmed Abdul Moler Saed Abdul Hafid received an anxious call from his brother that evening, he feared the worst.\\n\\nAhmed Abdul Moler Saed Abdul Hafid lost five brothers and a close friend to the LNA-allied Kanis (MEE/Daniel Hilton)\\n\\n“The call was short. All he managed to say was ‘I’ve been stopped in my car’ before the line went dead. Immediately I realised the Kanis had him, and knew it would not end well.”\\n\\nAbdul Hafid, 39, had previous run-ins with the Kanis. Two years earlier they had extorted him and forced him to buy camels at an exorbitant price. But he’d always coped with their demands well. This time he assumed money could get him out of trouble again.\\n\\n“At around 12am I went to my family home, found the rest of my brothers and told them to gather as much money as they could for ransom.”\\n\\n\\'I lost five brothers to the Kanis, and a friend who was more than a brother\\' - Ahmed Abdul Moler Saed Abdul Hafid\\n\\nFrom there he went home, turned off all the lights and lay down with his wife, pretending no one was home. After a sleepless night, he heard more chilling news. The rest of his brothers had been taken.\\n\\nAbdul Hafid knew he had to get out, and with the help of a friend, who would then be seized for assisting him, crept out of Tarhuna and walked 80 km north to the town of Tajoura.\\n\\n“Everything they did came out of nowhere. You cannot even measure their criminal behaviour, there was no limit,” Abdul Hafid says, sitting bolt upright in his family’s reception room, the memories leaving his face pallid and wrought.\\n\\n“I lost five brothers to the Kanis, and a friend who was more than a brother,” he says. “There was no obvious reason for their arrest. We are businessmen, not al-Qaeda or the Muslim Brotherhood.”\\n\\nLike many other Tarhunis forced to flee, Abdul Hafid rushed back to his hometown the day the Kaniyat left. “When I walked through the door of my family’s home my mother fainted, then fainted again. I shouted ‘where are my brothers, where are my brothers?’ I knew something was deeply wrong.”\\n\\nThe prisons were open, but there was no sign of his siblings.\\n\\n“The Kanis are not people, they are savages. We heard reports people may have been fed to lions.”\\n\\nTarhuna\\'s torture prisons\\n\\nRumours of the torture prison the Kaniyat had created in a local agricultural testing centre had spread for weeks before they left Tarhuna, and the Kanis knew it.\\n\\nIn December, they had erected earth berm fortifications on two sides, fearing reprisal attacks from the families of those detained there.\\n\\nA mural of Mohsen al-Kani in a detention centre used by the Kaniyat (Supplied)\\n\\nWhen GNA forces eventually took the complex, they found seven, square-metre compartments, each of which was just large enough to accommodate a crouched man. On the counter above them lay mounds of ash from fires the Kaniyat used to turn the tiny cells into ovens.\\n\\n“When we discovered this place we found one man still crouched inside an oven - he was alive but in a terrible state. He wouldn’t come out, he thought we were the Kaniyat playing a trick on him,” says Kosher.\\n\\n\\'Sometimes the prisoners would come back, sometimes they had been killed\\' - Ali Asaid Abu Zweid, former prisoner\\n\\nMuch of the facility is now blackened and charred, following fires Tarhunis lit in anguish when they realised their relatives couldn’t be found. But cardboard mattresses and fingerprints smeared down cell walls hint at its former use.\\n\\nAli Asaid Abu Zweid was held in one of these cells for 45 days, during which he barely spoke a word to the detainees to his left and right.\\n\\n“We remained almost completely silent while held there, because no one thought it would be safe to talk to each other,” he says.\\n\\nIt’s unclear exactly why he was seized and held here, though Abu Zweid suspects it’s because he’d fought alongside pro-GNA Misratans against the Islamic State group in Sirte in 2015, but refused to take up arms against them in Tripoli.\\n\\nHe lost 30kg over a month and a half. “When they took someone off to be interrogated you’d hear gunshots,” he recalls, standing outside his former cell. “Sometimes the prisoners would come back, sometimes they had been killed.\\n\\n“Occasionally they’d light fires over the ovens – it depended on our guards’ mood.”\\n\\nAli Asaid Abu Zweid was kept in this oven-like cell for 45 days (MEE/Daniel Hilton)\\n\\nFurther into town, the Kaniyat used a former interior ministry security branch as a detention facility, where they held the majority of prisoners. Scores were confined here at once, crammed into half-a-dozen rooms strewn with plastic bottles used as toilets.\\n\\nIn one cell, brightly coloured children’s shoes are scattered over the floor.\\n\\nLike the agricultural centre, the majority of people held here are still missing. Left behind by the Kaniyat instead are a falanga instrument to beat detainees’ feet and a mural of Mohsen al-Kani, staring out into the courtyard and giving the thumbs up.\\n\\nA few names of people and places have been etched into the heavy metal doors that locked people in, along with dates. Officials investigating the disappearances believe these signify days when events happened, including purges. Some dates have several marks scored beside them, possibly marking the number of people killed at that time.\\n\\nThe cost of the Kanis\\n\\nTarhunis are still counting the cost to their town’s social fabric. The Kanis turned cousin against cousin. Those who managed to flee the town say they have been subject to vicious rumours.\\n\\nBut for women like Gazalla Ali Awness, who watched the Kani snatch seven of her sons, just providing for the dependents they left behind is a struggle. She now has around 40 grandchildren to support.\\n\\n\\'I don’t want money or food, I just want my sons, give me just one\\' - Gazalla Ali Awness, Tarhuna\\n\\n“The oldest man we have left is this one, he is 13,” she says, running her fingers through a boy’s thick black hair.\\n\\nSurrounded by children, Awness looks up at the sky and flings out her arms, desperation and loss cracking her voice. “I don’t want money or food, I just want my sons, give me just one.”\\n\\nWithout a body, moving on mentally and emotionally can be near impossible. But economically, too. Under conservative Islamic tradition, a woman can’t remarry until her husband is confirmed dead. With so many missing, and so many bodies yet to be identified, several of Tarhuna’s women are unable to turn a page or secure support from a new breadwinner.\\n\\n“Now I have to do everything myself, and provide everything for my grandchildren and their mothers,” Awness says.\\n\\nThough it has been weeks since the Kaniyat last stalked these streets, nerves are frayed.\\n\\nResidents told MEE they avoid reporting relatives and friends who are missing because people they saw as complicit with the Kanis’ rule can still be seen around the municipal office.\\n\\nJust the sight of men carrying weapons is too much for children of the Jaballah family, who burst into tears and hide every time the security services roll past their home.\\n\\nTarek Ali al-Jaballah was shot on the street in front of his young son in December. The next day, the Kaniyat rounded up 10 more members of the family. “Leave no men,” Sabri al-Gharb, a former Gaddafi loyalist leading the raid, is reported to have said.\\n\\nRabia al-Jaballah, third from right, and other women of her family (MEE/Daniel Hilton)\\n\\n“I have lost my husband, four brothers, one uncle and four cousins,” Rabia al-Jaballah says, fighting back tears. “I’m still frightened.”\\n\\n“My brother was shot,” a teenage girl sitting behind her says.\\n\\n“My father is missing,” another adds. “I miss him. I have dreams, I wanted to become a doctor, but I can’t do this without him.”\\n\\nReprisals in Tarhuna\\n\\nThe days that followed the GNA forces taking Tarhuna were pandemonium, with looting, arson and arrests recorded in several victorious fighters’ social media posts.\\n\\nLions kept by Mohsen and suspected to be fed with his victims were shot dead at his abandoned home.\\n\\nSources in the town told MEE at the time that extrajudicial killings were carried out. Kosher insists just a couple of people were killed in an inter-family dispute, although sources in western Libya have quietly acknowledged that reprisal killings could have reached the dozens.\\n\\nPro-Haftar media has seized on this narrative, ignoring the mass graves or blaming them on Syrian mercenaries while disassociating the LNA from the Kaniyat.\\n\\n\\'I’m sure that Haftar was not receiving a text message every time a kid was killed, of course not, but that doesn’t take away from the sense of responsibility and complicity\\' - Jalel Harchaoui, analyst\\n\\nYet the Kanis, the Kaniyat fighters and their families – totalling around 15,000 people overall – are still hosted by Haftar in east Libya. Abdul-Rahim al-Kani has married into a prominent tribal family in the eastern city of Ajdabiya, whose fighters fought alongside the Kaniyat in Tripoli, and has even reportedly travelled to Germany for medical treatment.\\n\\nThe Kaniyat presence in the east is not particularly welcome, however. Mahmoud al-Werfalli, an LNA commander wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, reportedly refused to allow the Kanis to settle in Haftar’s capital Benghazi.\\n\\n“They’re not accepted there, they’re considered radioactive,” Harchaoui, the analyst, says. “If you go to war together, and then the war turns out to be a catastrophe on every level, then you’re going to hate each other.”\\n\\nThat said, during the Tripoli offensive, Haftar and his backers, including the UAE media, talked up the Kaniyat and stressed its legitimacy as part of the LNA. At one stage, the Kanis’ militia was combined with veteran LNA unit the 22nd Brigade to create the 9th Brigade, consolidating its place in Haftar’s ranks cosmetically and practically.\\n\\n“I’m sure that Haftar was not receiving a text message every time a kid was killed, of course not, but that doesn’t take away from the sense of responsibility and complicity,” Harchaoui says.\\n\\n“You can call it indirect, if you want. You can call it opaque, if you want. But it’s still complicity with an actor that everybody knew committed these atrocities.”\\n\\nA pair of high heels next to a bullet hole-ridden car (MEE/Daniel Hilton)\\n\\nFatou Bensouda, the ICC’s prosecutor, has said the discovery of men, women and children buried in Tarhuna’s mass graves “may constitute evidence of war crimes or crimes against humanity”.\\n\\nThe ICC prosecutor’s office told MEE it is “following up on this matter in particular with the competent Libyan authorities, in accordance with the principle of complementarity, to ensure that these mass graves are investigated”.\\n\\nThe LNA, meanwhile, described the mass graves as \"crimes against humanity\".\\n\\n\"They were committed before the army went to Tripoli when the Kaniyat militia was affiliated with the forces of the Government of National Accord,\" LNA spokesman Major General Ahmed al-Mismari told MEE.\\n\\nMismari would not commit to sending any wanted people in LNA territory to The Hague if requested by the ICC, and did not respond to questions about whether Haftar\\'s forces took responsibility for crimes committed by militias fighting under their banner.\\n\\nIn Tarhuna, there\\'s a growing realisation that the remains of all the town\\'s missing can only be recovered if the Kaniyat reveal their whereabouts. \"Those in the east know where the bodies are buried,” says Kosher.\\n\\nAnd for Tarhuni survivors like Rabia al-Jallabah, the onus is on Haftar to recognise the murders committed under his watch and stop giving shelter to those responsible.\\n\\n“We want the UN to put pressure on Haftar. All we want is for the criminals who escaped to the east to be brought to justice,\" she says. \"They will do in the east what they did here.”',\n",
              " 'Nicknamed \"The Eagle of Iran\" by his peers because of the golden eagle tattoo on his back, Vahid Moradi was a notorious gangster who spent most of his life in and out of Iranian prisons.\\n\\nNot much is known about his upbringing or childhood, but throughout his life, The Eagle served multiple prison sentences for various crimes, including gang-related fights and being a member of a criminal organisation.\\n\\n\\n\\nMoradi is also one of the men profiled in Crime Wave Tehran, a research project and photo book on Iran’s criminal underworld, edited and published by Iranian-Dutch artist and researcher Pouria Khojastehpay in 2018.\\n\\nVahid Moradi, aka \"The Eagle of Iran\", outside the Imam Reza Shrine in Mashhad, Iran. (Pouria Khojastehpay)\\n\\nKhojastehpay describes “The Eagle” as “a real and respected gangster in every sense”. “He was the main inspiration for the book and my print series,” Khojastehpay told MEE.\\n\\nIn one photograph, Moradi stands with a hand placed respectfully over his heart. He would blend seamlessly into the surrounding crowd were it not for the tattoo of a gun on his hand and the other of a tear drop below his left eye.\\n\\nKnown for being somewhat of a “survivor”, he managed to endure several bullet wounds, before his luck eventually ran out.\\n\\nIn 2018 The Eagle was arrested for the murder of an associate during a party thrown to celebrate his prison release. Soon after, back in jail, he was killed by fellow inmates following a dispute in the prison yard.\\n\\nThe Eagle pictured relaxing in an unidentified location believed to be used as a meeting place. (Pouria Khojastehpay)\\n\\nIn the book, a portrait of Moradi taken on the day he was arrested shows him standing alone. He is dressed in a collared shirt and his eyes have been blurred out by Khojastehpay. Moradi’s chest and neck tattoos are visible, including a scorpion inked into his left ear and the teardrop which sits under his left eye, above a large scar that runs across the side of his face.\\n\\nAccording to the book, in an interview with Iranian media outlet Rokna News, conducted on the day of his arrest, Moradi had said: “Imprisoning me will not change anything. I am who I am.”\\n\\nThe Eagle left behind a wife, and a son, who Moradi had dreamed might become a doctor or an engineer one day, according to Khojastehpay’s sources. Both still live in Iran.\\n\\nAfter he was sent snapshots of Iran\\'s gangsters, Khojastehpay began collecting an archive of images, including that of Moradi (above) that would evolve into a book. (Pouria Khojastehpay)\\n\\nSince the book\\'s release, Khojastehpay has gone on to produce an entire exhibition on the subject. Although currently on hold due to Covid-19 restrictions, a planned Paris show will feature some of the images from the book as well as additional images, all of which will be presented as a print series titled Gangstehran.\\n\\n“The book was a general coverage and introduction to the concept and world. The prints are more of a sociology project of how they [gangsters] portray themselves. They show their strong body language,” Khojastehpay told MEE.\\n\\nThe world of organised crime\\n\\nThe Eagle’s story is just one of several powerful portraits Khojastehpay has gathered over four years in an aim to upturn perceptions of this overlooked segment of society.\\n\\nAuthored and published through Khojastehpay’s own publishing company 550bc, Crime Wave Tehran is a carefully curated and meticulously edited collection of over 90 photographs documenting the portraits and lives of some of the country’s most notorious gang members.\\n\\nTaken between 2013 and 2018, the images in the book give the reader a glimpse into the criminal underworld in Iran, and also the private lives and personalities of these men, some of whom have spent much of their lives in and out of incarceration in Iran’s toughest prisons, including Rajai-Shahr and Ghezel Hesar in the Tehran suburb of Karaj.\\n\\n\\'Many Iranians had no idea this existed in Iran\\' - Pouria Khojastehpay, Dutch-Iranian artist\\n\\nThrough the book, we are made privy to intimate scenes from bank robberies, drug trafficking, and dog fighting, but it also touches on this section of society’s interactions with the state.\\n\\nMany of the photos show how these men come head to head with the police. One man is pictured after a drug trafficking raid, held by a masked officer on either side of him as they expose his tattooed torso and announce his crimes over a megaphone in an attempt to highlight the connection between body art and crime.\\n\\nWhen it was first released, Crime Wave Tehran generated a large wave of interest online, stemming largely from the fact that the book is a first of its kind. Khojastehpay’s publishing company, 550 bc, now boasts over 21,000 followers on Instagram.\\n\\n“Many Iranians had no idea this existed in Iran,” Khojastehpay says. \"It’s a taboo in Iran or the Middle East to talk about it in general.”\\n\\nKhojastehpay recalls how Iranians expressed how strange it was that the criminal underworld he had brought to light was so little known within the country. One person praised the way his work keeps Iranian culture \"intact\" and how it avoids the \"cliches and Western trends and romanticised ideas of the Middle East\".\\n\\n“In general many people were stunned to realise Iran has gangsters of this size and signature look,” said Khojastehpay.\\n\\nThree men posing inside a prison in Karaj, taken using a smart phone that was smuggled into prison. (Pouria Khojastehpay)\\n\\nThe book project began in 2016, when Khojastehpay came across an Instagram profile showing a photograph of an Iranian man with prison tattoos. This intrigued him as he was aware that tattoos are a taboo in Iran, and usually associated with criminals. He then got into contact with the person behind the Instagram account who gave him more details about this man’s story and sent him some photographs.\\n\\nIntrigued by the lives of these men, he dug deeper into the stories delivered by his friend and was soon sent more photos of them to add to his growing archive. He began searching for references in Iranian media archives and online, coming across news reports about some of the men he had by then encountered.\\n\\nPoetry of the underworld\\n\\nAs his research developed, he realised that the stories of these men had not been previously told in media or arts. More importantly, he discovered that the way they represented themselves on social media and in their daily lives was in sharp contrast to the way they were shamed and vilified in the Iranian media.\\n\\nA HK G3 rifle from an illegal arms trader in Tehran. (Pouria Khojastehpay)\\n\\nA softer side of the men pictured throughout Crime Wave Tehran is shown in subtle ways. Some of their tattoos depict the names of lovers, and Persian poems about heartbreak and loneliness.\\n\\nOne such poem, inked across the back of one man reads: “Do not break my heart, even though you broke my heart in the past, do not break my heart. Now trust is just a fairytale.”\\n\\nIn another photo, a man’s tattooed eyelids read “shab” and “bekheir,” meaning “goodnight” in Persian.\\n\\n\\'The narratives around crime and criminals are heavily influenced by the journalists’ responsibility to the law and the legal system of the country they are reporting in.\\' - Mahmoud Fazal, crime journalist\\n\\nKhojastehpay’s editing focuses on the individuals, their facial expressions and body language, and alludes to their personalities and humanity.\\n\\nEmbedded into the portraits are also images of crime scenes depicting violence, from a blood splattered floor in a jewellery shop, to CCTV footage of what appears to be a bank robbery.\\n\\nBrotherhood between the men is also depicted, particularly in one photograph of three men standing shoulder to shoulder in prison, smiling into the camera of a smartphone that was smuggled in, according to the accompanying text.\\n\\n“I changed the derogatory context Iranian state media displays and talks about these individuals and tried to show a more poetic, respectful way,” said Khojastehpay.\\n\\nThe reason for this disparity, says crime journalist Mahmoud Fazal, whose essay “Theatre of Cruelty” appears in the opening pages of the book, is that the narratives around crime and criminals are heavily influenced by the journalists’ responsibility to the law and the legal system of the country they are reporting in.\\n\\n“But Pouria’s work is untouched,” Fazal told MEE. “The so-called criminals document themselves in the way they wish to be represented and viewed. We are offered a glimpse into their world through their eyes.”\\n\\nTattoos and taboos\\n\\nOne striking visual element of the photographs is the tattoos of the men pictured. Tattoos are not an uncommon sighting in Tehran today among young people, but there are still negative associations with the art, linking it to criminal activity.\\n\\nThis reformed gangster is posing in front of a collection of short Persian swords known as “ghameh” that are used in brutal knife fights and ib Shia mourning rituals that are banned under Iranian law. (Pouria Khojastehpay)\\n\\nAlthough having tattoos is not strictly forbidden by law or by religion in Iran, tattoo artists are regularly arrested and football players are asked to cover their arms when playing publicly or run the risk of being dropped from the national team.\\n\\nIn Crime Wave Tehran, a selection of images from media reports show police officers displaying the bare, tattoo-covered torsos of the men upon arrest for the photos, which are then printed in news reports.\\n\\nA gangster pictured in unknown whereabouts holding up an AK-47, with scars on his arms from knife fights. (Pouria Khojastehpay)\\n\\nThese tattoos are very different to those you might see on young men in the affluent northern suburbs of Tehran, which tend to be in the classic western style of roses, skulls, and the like.\\n\\nSome tattoos on the men in this book include religious symbols rooted in Shia visual culture, such as portraits of Imam Ali and text reading “Ya Ali” in Persian.\\n\\nAnother is a cropped close-up of the neck and chest of a man wearing a pendant inscribed with Vanyakad, a verse in the Quran read for protection from the evil eye. Images of Imam Ali also appear on the walls against which the men pose in front of.\\n\\nPoetry also features strongly in the tattoos of the men in the book. One reads \\'zakhmy tar az hamishe\\' meaning \\'more hurt than ever\\' in English\\n\\nAside from the religious element, other tattoos include animals such as tigers and birds of prey, nods to the Persian empire in the form of text reading \"Mada\" or the Medes, an ancient Iranian people, as well as profiles of men and women resembling Persian miniatures.\\n\\nKhojastehpay describes some of this imagery as an embodiment of Iranian tattoo culture. “Most of the tattoos are done by underground tattoo artists in their own social circles. Persian miniature tattoos have been common for decades in Iran, mostly made popular by pre-revolution wrestlers,” says Khojastehpay.\\n\\nPoetry also features strongly in the tattoos of the men in the book. One reads “zakhmy tar az hamishe” meaning “more hurt than ever” in English and another, “dele man daryae”, meaning “my heart is an ocean”.\\n\\nTeardrop tattoos are also common, which can be used after someone has experienced some form of grief or loss, suggests a tender core to men with the burly exteriors.\\n\\n\"I think the teardrop tattoos some depicted gangsters have are my favourite,\" Khojastehpay says. \"When it’s just an outline, it can mean mourning someone close to them that died by violence, to seek revenge for this person, or for ‘gunah’ - sins. When it’s filled black, it often means that one has killed or has [finished] a lengthy prison sentence.\"\\n\\nSaviours and martyrs\\n\\nWhile some of the men in the book like The Eagle may have become infamous for their involvement in organised crime, in their own communities they were seen as Robin Hood figures.\\n\\n“The give money back to the neighbourhoods they are from,” Khojastehpay told MEE. “They recruit from these areas too. So they are often praised as saviours, and when they pass, they pass as martyrs.”\\n\\nA photograph taken of The Eagle’s best friend and most loyal henchman paying his respects at his gravestone at the Behesht Zahra cemetery in southern Tehran.

After trawling through hundreds of social media posts, media archives, and photographs sent to him through contacts, he collated a large number of images, many of which were of poor quality.\\n\\nMoradi’s best friend and most loyal henchman, posing to show his tattoos and \"battle\" scars. (Pouria Khojastehpay)\\n\\nCommitted to editing the photographs to produce a unified body of work, Khojastehpay made the necessary technical enhancements, and rendered most of them black and white.\\n\\n“This editing took a lot of time, but was crucial to give the viewer the idea that this was all taken by one hand, like a photo documentary series,” he explains.\\n\\nSome of the men featured in the book told Khojastehpay that, although they didn\\'t oppose its publication, they couldn’t quite understand why he put it together.\\n\\nOthers such as gangster HB, who recently passed, reached out to him personally, Khojastehpay says. “He wrote me over Instagram saying ‘damet garm soltan\\' [an expression used to express significant appreciation].\"\\n\\nHB roamed in similar circles to The Eagle, but many of his tattoos had been blacked out, which is believed to be a sign of reformation. His tattooed tear under his eye remained intact.\\n\\nThe nuances of living a life of crime come through boldly in Khojastehpay’s work, who shows us how hardened criminals are also fathers, brothers, and respected leaders. They can love their country and their faith, and fend for their communities.\\n\\n\\'In the criminal world...our willingness to sacrifice for one another is what gets us through life\\' - Mahmoud Fazal, crime journalist\\n\\nFazal, the journalist who was himself a former member of an outlaw motorcycle club in Australia, says there is a strong sense of comradery among these groups that not many people realise.\\n\\n“In the criminal world, the central tenant is that we are all in this together - right or wrong. So it’s an old humanistic idea, relying on each other, not the state, on culture, not the faith - our willingness to sacrifice for one another is what gets us through life,” he says.\\n\\nCrime Wave Tehran offers an unadulterated view of this multifaceted segment of society, carefully and respectfully curated to present myriad views of humanity.\\n\\nIn the same way, the book also represents a grey area in our understanding of Iran as a country and its people, which is all too often painted as black and white, good versus bad, revolution vs the Pahlavi dynasty, modern versus traditional, Islam versus secularism.\\n\\nIn reality, whether on the fringes of society or not, life is much more complex, murky, and subtle.\\n\\nCrime Wave Tehran, edited by Pouria Khojastehpay in respect towards the individuals featured, is currently out of print but more information on his work that involves gangsters is available via 550bc.',\n",
              " \"For me, it all started at the age of 12 when I suddenly went off meat and chicken. It might have had something to do with my love for animals. Growing up in Bahrain, home was a place we shared with cats and dogs, some of which I named when I was only four years old.\\n\\nOne of my earliest memories was being taught how to gently pet Mary, our Persian cat who lived to the age of 14. Dogs like Honey, Maggie, Blake, Rocky and Clea were childhood companions, and pets became family members who we collectively cared for.\\n\\n'After reading a harrowing tale about a farmer slicing off the snout of a live pig ... I knew I would never eat meat again' - Nada Elbarshoumi\\n\\nIt also helped that from a young age, I adored vegetables, even all the ones my brother refused to go near. There wasn’t a single leafy green that didn’t agree with me. I always went back for seconds of my mother’s classic Egyptian stews – including bamia, the slimy, green okra dish that is as unappealing to Arab children as brussel sprouts are to western kids.\\n\\nBut my family, like many in the Middle East, were still heavy consumers of meat in all of its forms. And when it comes to Arab hospitality, serving these dishes extends far beyond the hedonistic pleasures of taste. An iftar table during Ramadan, for example, isn’t complete without a healthy spread of meat-based platters, mounds of fragrant spiced rice and lashings of yoghurt and cheese. To present a meal featuring nothing but vegetables would be unheard of: “We’re not destitute. Why wouldn’t we serve meat?”\\n\\nMeat is also closely associated with several religious celebrations. In Egypt, Coptic Christians celebrate Easter day by feasting on meat and Egyptian fatteh \\xad\\xad– the traditional dish of rice, meat and crispy flatbread, which Egyptian Muslims also prepare for Eid al-Adha. This “festival of sacrifice” observed by some 1.8 billion Muslims worldwide has ritual animal sacrifice at its core.\\n\\nOther delicacies consumed in Egypt, this time to celebrate the advent of spring, or Sham El Nesseem, are the pungent, salted fish feseekh and molouha.\\n\\nElbarshoumi was studying in the UK and missing here mama's cooking when she launched her blog (Courtesy of onearabvegan.com)\\n\\nDairy too\\n\\nBut it wasn't just meat. After years of battling near-chronic sinus-infections, I discovered I had a sensitivity to dairy products. Within days of cutting out my beloved cheese toasties and begrudgingly handing my last block of halloumi over to my roommate, my symptoms had all but disappeared.\\n\\nAs I began to read around the other purported health benefits of a plant-based diet, I decided to give veganism a go. A month later, I felt better than ever. I could breathe easily and was sleeping better as a result, had bounds of energy, clearer skin and a settled stomach.\\n\\nBy this point, I was studying at university in the UK and struggling with some body image issues. When I decided yet again to try and lose some weight, I came across the book Skinny Bitch. What I thought was going to be the secret to a svelte new physique, turned out to be a no-nonsense, eye-opening expose on the detriments of an animal-based diet and the horrors of the animal agriculture industry.\\n\\nIt was after reading a harrowing tale about a farmer slicing off the snout of a live pig as he screamed in agony that I knew I would never eat meat again.\\n\\nRoasted cauliflower with a tahini and cumin dressing (Courtesy of oneaarabvegan.com)\\n\\nMaking the transition\\n\\nIt wasn’t easy to begin with, but I had made a commitment and wanted to make sure it would be lasting. After all, in a region where kebabs, kibbeh and lamb tagines are ubiquitous, it’s hard enough to give up meat, let alone dairy too. But it's not impossible.\\n\\nWhat have I learnt along the way?\\n\\nAvoid labelling yourself in the beginning. Though there is no need to lie or hide your efforts to go vegan, it is important to be aware that labels can often sound provocative, intimidating, and might categorise you as a potential cause for concern, especially with more traditionally minded family members.\\n\\nElbarshoumi posts recipes of vegan-friendly Middle Eastern dishes on her blog (Courtesy of onearabvegan.com)\\n\\nNext, do your research. It helps to have a few statistics on hand and make sure you can confidently answer questions like: “Where do you get your protein from?” and “Oh, but you eat fish, right?” and the popular plea: “But God gave us meat, why would you refuse such a blessing?”\\n\\nIf someone genuinely wants to learn more about your lifestyle, then you can suggest a vegan documentary for them to watch, email an academic article on plant-based diets or send a vegan meme to your group chat. It’s all in the delivery, and you may be surprised at how open your family and friends will be.\\n\\nCooking is also a great way to communicate how varied and satisfying a vegan diet can be. Once people see for themselves how simple preparing tasty vegan food can be, it is much easier for them to accept. Who can resist a bright bowl of beetroot hummus, or a fragrant pumpkin kibbeh stuffed with spinach and chickpeas?\\n\\nLastly, don’t forget to practise what you preach. This means not wrinkling your nose at the meat on the table, and keeping the passive-aggressive commentary about what someone else is eating to yourself.\\n\\nTips for travellers\\n\\nFor the vegan-curious traveller to the Middle East – I have good news for you.\\n\\nDespite the meat-centric diet of the typical Arab household, Middle Eastern cuisine itself is incredibly diverse, with no shortage of delicious and nutritious dishes that just happen to be vegan.\\n\\nAlmost any Arabic restaurant will serve a decent selection of vegan mezze, salads and soups – think falafel, ful (fava beans), hummus, baba ghanoush, stuffed vine leaves, spicy potatoes, tabbouleh, fattoush, rocket salad, or a side of lentil soup. The list goes on.\\n\\nI’ve become an expert at constructing a main meal out of sides – my go-to combo is a big bowl of whatever salads are on hand, topped with falafel, balila (chickpeas sautéed with olive oil, lemon and garlic) and a dollop of my all-time favourite, hummus.\\n\\nIf you happen to be in Egypt, koshary is a popular dish combining rice, pasta, lentils, chickpeas, fried onions and a fiery tomato sauce.\\n\\n'...all over the world, food represents much more than just sustenance. It’s the way we communicate our heritage and background' - Nada Elbarshoumi\\n\\nBut if you’re dining out, you’ll need to check whether dairy products have been added to the dips, sauces and pastry dough (such as manakish) and whether soups or stews were made with an animal-based stock.\\n\\nOne summer, my father and I were dining at a popular local restaurant in downtown Cairo when I bit into some wara’ 'enab (stuffed vine leaves) and was struck with an overwhelming flavour of meat. To my dismay, the meat-free stuffing had been boiled in a bone-broth stock.\\n\\nDon’t be surprised if the term “vegan” draws a blank in some restaurants – the phenomenon is still relatively new in the region. If you’re in Egypt or any Arab country with a significant Christian population, however, try asking for the more commonly recognised seyami options – food prepared for Christians fasting during lent.\",\n",
              " 'Labour\\'s investigations into antisemitism raise questions about the nature and definition of what the party is attempting to root out\\n\\nIn July 2019, the BBC broadcast the Panorama programme Is Labour Anti-Semitic?, about the allegations made against the party.\\n\\nIt included reporting about the Labour Party\\'s own inquiry into the Liverpool Riverside constituency during the autumn of 2016.\\n\\nPanorama spoke to party member Ben Westerman, the only Jewish official on the complaints team, who it reported \"was confronted with the very antisemitism he\\'d been sent to investigate\".\\n\\nWesterman told Panorama that, after one interview had finished, he was asked by one of those present: \"Where are you from... Are you from Israel?\"\\n\\nBBC headquarters in central London: the broadcaster has defended the Panorama report Is Labour Anti-Semitic? (Reuters)\\n\\nWesterman is clearly upset as he recalls what happened. \"What can you say to that?\" he tells Panorama. \"You\\'re assumed to be in cahoots with the Israeli government.\"\\n\\nBut is his story accurate?\\n\\nThe interviewee Westerman spoke to that day appears to have been a woman called Helen Marks. As part of Labour Party procedure, she was allowed a \"silent witness\" who could observe, but not participate in, the interview, for which she chose her friend Rica Bird. With Westerman\\'s permission, they recorded the conversation. The programme omitted to mention that Marks and Bird, both 74, are Jewish. Neither, they said, knew that Westerman was Jewish.\\n\\nAt the end there is an exchange that closely matches the one described in Panorama – except that there is no mention of Israel. Bird, conversationally, asks Westerman which Labour Party branch he belongs to. \"I was just making chit-chat really,\" she told MEE.\\n\\nIn response to a complaint from Marks, the BBC suggested in November 2019 that the \"she\" Westerman referred to may have been a different interviewee. But transcripts and recordings from the interviews involving the other four women Westerman spoke to contain no such conversation. All four women are adamant that it did not take place after the recorder had been switched off.\\n\\nMarks and Bird are upset and angry. \"My father lost family in the Holocaust,\" says Marks. \"It was like my own Jewishness simply didn\\'t count – I was the wrong sort of Jew.\"\\n\\nThe BBC told MEE: \"We stand by our journalism.\" Neither Ben Westerman nor his lawyers responded to a request for comment at time of publication.\\n\\nNo mainstream media have reported this version of events. Westerman was among the contributors to the Panorama programme who in July received an apology and a payoff from the Labour Party, which had initially described them as being \"disaffected former employees\" with \"political axes to grind\". The party says it now accepts this description was \"defamatory and false\".\\n\\nLabour, complaints and investigations\\n\\nThe incident involving Marks and Bird is an example of one little-reported aspect of the Labour antisemitism story – the frequency with which Jewish party members find themselves the centre of investigations, often on what they regard as the flimsiest and most tendentious of grounds.\\n\\nIt is a trend that appears to have gathered pace since Keir Starmer took over as Labour Party leader in April 2020. It raises profound questions about the nature and definition of the \"antisemitism\" that the party is attempting to root out.\\n\\nThen Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and his successor Keir Starmer attend a general election campaign meeting in November 2019 (Reuters)\\n\\n\\n\\nJewish Voice for Labour (JVL) is an organisation established in 2017 \"to protect the right of Labour Party members, mainly supporters of Jeremy Corbyn, to speak freely about Israel and Palestine,\" as described by Jenny Manson, its co-chair. Manson, like all other officers and committee members in JVL, is Jewish.\\n\\nManson says that, besides Marks, at least 24 other Jewish members of the party have come under formal investigation at one time or another, many of them more than once. JVL committee member Mike Cushman, who has himself been investigated in the past, says: \"For a Jewish person, to be accused of antisemitism is as devastating as to be confronted with antisemitism. It\\'s even worse when the accusation comes from someone who isn\\'t Jewish themselves.\"\\n\\nMEE understands that one Jewish Labour Party member has taken an overdose following expulsion from the party. \"Notices of Investigation\" sent to party members include a telephone number for the Samaritans.\\n\\nReporting on this issue is complicated by the fact that the Labour Party demands members under investigation do not discuss details of their case. But a number of Jewish party members have received Notices of Investigation during the last few months while under lockdown. A feature of the radical Jewish left in the Labour Party is that many are elderly, often living alone.\\n\\nContacted about the concerns raised in this article, the Labour Party responded: \"The Labour Party takes all complaints of antisemitism extremely seriously and they are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures, and any appropriate disciplinary action is taken.\"\\n\\nDiana Neslen, 80, is a disabled Jewish widow who lives in Ilford, Essex. A fervent Zionist during her youth, she became disillusioned after witnessing the treatment of Palestinians during a trip to Israel at the end of the 1950s. Born in South Africa, she is a lifelong anti-racist campaigner and a member of the Labour Party.\\n\\n\\'They have no sense that Jewish people have different views\\' - Diana Neslen\\n\\nIn September 2018, Neslen received a formal warning about her conduct, accompanied by a list of her social media posts. These included the statement that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was \"making shameless political capital out of the Holocaust\".\\n\\n\"On Holocaust Memorial Day let us remember that not only a people but their culture was destroyed,\" she wrote. \"In my view Jewish people need to disinter that culture and turn our backs on the nationalism that has superseded it.\" She was told in the letter from the Labour Party: \"These comments have caused offence.\"\\n\\nNeslen ran into trouble again in January this year as the proposer of a motion at her local party branch calling on the Labour leadership to reject the \"10 pledges\" that the Jewish Board of Deputies had demanded the party sign up to following the December 2019 general election.\\n\\nThese include a pledge that any party member supporting a member who has been suspended or expelled should themselves be suspended. Neslen\\'s motion passed but local members said that antisemitic \"tropes\" had been used at the meeting. She fiercely denies this and says that, besides herself, there were just two Jewish people present, one of whom spoke in support of her motion.\\n\\nNeslen is furious. \"At the end of the day, it\\'s a bunch of non-Jews piling on to a Jew,\" she says. \"These people know nothing about antisemitism and Jewishness. They have no sense that Jewish people have different views.\" In 1991, a member of the BNP was jailed for beating up Neslen\\'s son. \"I know what real antisemitism looks like,\" she says.\\n\\nGeorge Wilmers is a retired academic from Manchester who is Jewish and a Labour Party member. In July 2019 he received a Notice of Investigation following an allegation that he had stated at a meeting that the \"JLM [Jewish Labour Movement] were a front for Israel\".\\n\\nWilmers queries whether he would have used precisely these words. But he defends his criticism of the Jewish Labour Movement, which was anti-Corbyn and generally treated by the media as the principal representative of Jews in the Labour Party. Unlike JVL, it lists a commitment to \"Socialist Zionism\" as one of its guiding principles.\\n\\n\"They are affiliated to the Israeli Labor Party, which I regard as an openly racist party,\" says Wilmers. He believes that the JLM\\'s activities seem to indicate that its main purpose is to \"demonise supporters of Palestinian rights, and in particular Jewish supporters, by publicly labelling them as antisemitic\".\\n\\nLike Neslen, Wilmers regards his treatment as antisemitic. He wrote to the Labour Party: \"It appears to me that that accusation was made against me because I have been targeted as a Jew by fanatical persons who hold that political support for the ethnocratic nature of the actually existing state of Israel is an essential characteristic of being Jewish.\"\\n\\nThe party eventually ruled that Wilmers\\' \"behaviour on this occasion did not amount to a breach of the Party’s Rules\". But he was sent a \"Reminder of Labour\\'s Values\" and urged to \"read them carefully and bear them in mind\" - advice that Wilmers told MEE was an \"insulting homily\".\\n\\nAntisemitism: The dividing line\\n\\nStephen Solley is a retired QC and former chair of the Bar Human Rights Committee. He is Jewish, a Labour Party member and a critic of Israel. On 28 January he received a campaign email from Miriam Mirwitch, chair of Young Labour, the party\\'s youth section, and a candidate for the London Assembly.\\n\\n\"I know what it\\'s like to face antisemitism every day,\" Mirwitch wrote, identifying herself as a national committee member of the Jewish Labour Movement. \"I\\'ve had to fight antisemitism both inside and outside the Labour Party,\" she said.\\n\\n\\'If they really want to expel the Jewish former Chair of the Bar Human Rights Committee, so be it\\'\\n\\n- Stephen Solley, retired QC\\n\\nSolley recalls: \"I got this just a week after Holocaust Remembrance Day. I thought this was the most offensive thing. She lives in modern north-west London. It\\'s absurd. Of course she doesn\\'t face antisemitism every day. It\\'s just whipping up anxiety. I was really upset by it.\" He replied to Mirwitch with a short, simple email. \"The Jewish Labour Movement is, in my opinion, a force for ill and something of a con in that it is destructive of socialism. It is a pro Israel, anti Palestine group. It becomes imperative to vote against you.\"\\n\\nTwenty-three minutes later, Mirwitch wrote to Solley\\'s former chambers, accusing him of antisemitism. She also wrote to the Bar Standards Board. Both rejected her accusations. But three days after sending the email, Solley received notification from the Labour Party that he was under investigation for antisemitism, an investigation that appears to be ongoing.\\n\\nSolley is aware that by speaking out he may have contravened the party\\'s demand that he \"keep all information and correspondence relating to this investigation private.\" His response? \"I don’t give a damn. If they really want to expel the Jewish former chair of the Bar Human Rights Committee, so be it.\"\\n\\nAlmost all the Jewish Labour Party members who find themselves under investigation have either made comments about Israel or Zionism or have questioned the logic of Labour disciplinary procedures. Many are supporters of Jewish Voice for Labour, which has been described by Guardian columnist Jonathan Freedland as representing \"a tiny fringe of British Jewish opinion\".\\n\\nJVL says it has well over 1,000 members, around a third of whom are Jewish. The rival Jewish Labour Movement has 3,000 members – Jewish and non-Jewish - but, unlike JVL, allows people to join who are not in the Labour Party.\\n\\nBoth JVL and JLM contain a range of views. But a key dividing line is their attitude to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, adopted by the Labour Party following pressure from JLM and others in September 2018.\\n\\nThe definition is opposed by JVL. \"The IHRA definition is hopelessly vague, muddled and open-ended,\" says Avi Shlaim, an Israeli JVL member and Emeritus Professor of International Relations at the University of Oxford. \"It deliberately conflates anti-Zionism with antisemitism in order to deter legitimate criticisms of Israel. It has 11 \\'illustrative examples\\' of antisemitism. Seven of them relate to Israel. That\\'s the giveaway. Antisemitism is hatred of Jews as Jews. That\\'s all we need.\"\\n\\nCriticism of the IHRA definition focuses in particular on example number seven:\\n\\n\"Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour.\"\\n\\nMiriam Margolyes, 79, a Jewish actor and Labour Party member, says that the clause serves to stifle debate about the origins and nature of the Israeli state. \"When I was young, we were taught the Arabs ran away,\" she says. \"They didn\\'t. They were driven out.\" She believes Israel to be a state rooted in the domination of one ethnicity over another. \"I don’t want a Jewish state. I want a shared state.\"\\n\\nJewish comedian Alexei Sayle, 68, who is not a Labour Party member but a patron of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, agrees. \"This is real through the looking glass stuff,\" he says. \"The people being accused of antisemitism are almost all defenders of the oppressed and lifelong fighters against racism. Many of the people who are accusing them are very much not that. The media\\'s coverage has been breath-taking in its laziness and one-sidedness.\"\\n\\nNot all opponents of the IHRA definition necessarily believe Israel to be an inherently racist state. \"Zionism began as a national liberation struggle of the Jewish people - an anti-racist movement in fact,\" says Shlaim. He believes it became a \"colonial enterprise\" following the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967.\\n\\nBut all are united in the view that example seven represents a fundamental denial of free speech, above all because the vast majority of Palestinians firmly believe Zionism to have been, inevitably and unavoidably, a \"racist endeavour\".\\n\\nA Palestinian viewpoint\\n\\nGhada Karmi is a London-based Palestinian author whose widely acclaimed memoir, In Search of Fatima, describes her own experience of being driven from West Jerusalem as a child in 1948 at the time of the creation of the state of Israel.\\n\\n\"My family left following the massacre at Deir Yassin, just a few miles away from our home, a massacre carried out by Jewish militias,\" she says. \"We left because we were terrified that we would be next. We thought we\\'d be away just a few weeks, but we were never allowed to return. This happened to us because we were Palestinian. Am I not allowed to call this ethnic cleansing?\\n\\n\"Zionism – as put in practice – was always a racist, colonial enterprise rooted in dispossession. How could it be anything else in a land full of people of a different ethnicity? If someone wants to disagree with that analysis or understanding – fine. If they want to debate – that\\'s fine. But do they really have the right to outlaw it?\" she says.\\n\\nIn August 2018, 24 Palestinian civil society groups published a statement pleading with the Labour Party not to adopt the IHRA definition. The definition \"attempts to erase Palestinian history, demonise solidarity with the Palestinian struggle for freedom, justice and equality, suppress freedom of expression, and shield Israel’s far-right regime of occupation, settler-colonialism and apartheid,\" the statement said. It was ignored by the Labour Party and was barely reported.\\n\\nGaza: The Palestinians who died during the Great March of Return Read More »\\n\\nBen Jamal, director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, says that the IHRA definition and the furore over antisemitism in the Labour Party have had a \"chilling effect\" on advocacy work for Palestinians.\\n\\nDuring 2018, at the height of the row, 290 Palestinians, including 55 minors, were killed by Israeli forces. This number included 190 deaths related to the Great March of Return in Gaza, when Palestinians demanded their right to go back to ancestral homes from which they were driven in 1948. Most of those killed in Gaza were shot by Israeli snipers crouching behind sand berms several hundred metres away, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.\\n\\nJamal says that in the past a significant minority of Labour MPs supported demonstrations in defence of Palestinian human rights – but that year \"it became incredibly difficult to get any MPs to come along\".\\n\\nOn 14 May 2018, more than 60 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces in a single day (some dying later from their injuries). Only then, Jamal says, did more than 20 MPs from various parties attend a rally.\\n\\n\"I remember commenting at the time,\" Jamal says, \"at least now we know how many Palestinians have to be killed before people regain their moral compass.\"\\n\\nBoth Jamal and Karmi say that anti-Zionism does not mean a desire for the destruction of Israel any more than opposition to apartheid during the 1980s meant a desire for the destruction of South Africa. \"I don\\'t want to drive anyone into the sea,\" Karmi says. \"What I believe is that Israel is under an obligation to grant equal rights to everyone it rules, regardless of religion or ethnicity.\"\\n\\n\\'Jews are being told they have to be Zionists\\'\\n\\nPalestinian activists and their Jewish supporters regard the adoption of the IHRA definition of antisemitism by the Labour Party as a victory for the concept of \"the new antisemitism,\" the belief, in the words of Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, that \"anti-Zionism is the latest mutation of the world\\'s longest hate\".\\n\\nBut Cushman says: \"For the first time in history, Jews are being told they have to be Zionists. It\\'s a heresy hunt. The Labour Party has been suborned in a battle between orthodox and heretical Jews. Why does the Labour Party get to decide what Jewish values are?\" Cushman says that he and others are part of a long tradition of non- and anti-Zionist Jewish socialism.\\n\\nGroups such as the JVL believe that the Board of Deputies\\' 10 Pledges – which Starmer has agreed to adopt – are a further attempt to exclude non-Zionist Jewish groups from any role in Labour Party policy or decision making.\\n\\nThe pledges include the demand that \"Labour must engage with the Jewish community via its main representative groups, and not through fringe organisations and individuals\".\\n\\nJVL does not dispute antisemitism exists in the Labour Party. \"We work hard to challenge and reduce it by education and constructive criticism,\" says co-chair Jenny Manson. But it advocates forcefully for those it feels have been wrongly accused and often receives vicious abuse as a result.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s Kafkaesque. You are not told who is accusing you. And you are not allowed to discuss it with anyone\\' - Naomi Wimborne-Idrissi\\n\\nManson, who is 71, says she has received a number of threats, including one left on her answerphone: \"You fucking Nazi bitch,\" it said. \"You should burn in the gas oven. You dirty fucking bitch…. Stinking, stinking swine… You deserve … to burn in acid.\" Police were able to track down the caller, a middle-aged Jewish man. He was formally cautioned for the offence of malicious communications in May 2019.\\n\\nNaomi Wimborne-Idrissi, 67, one of JVL\\'s founders, is a widow whose late husband was Moroccan. She says she has also received threats by telephone. \"\\'We know where you are, we are outside your door, we are going to put you in a wheelchair\\' - that sort of thing.\"\\n\\nShe has also been the subject of criticism by the prominent antisemitism campaigner David Collier. \"She can marry whomever she pleases and hold whatever ideological stance she finds attractive,\" Collier wrote. \"Naomi Wimborne was free to marry a Muslim, and become Naomi Wimborne-Idrissi... But, given her life choices, is Naomi really in a position to talk publicly as if she is representative of British Jewish identity?\"\\n\\nWimborne-Idrissi stresses the psychological impact on those Labour Party members who have received Notices of Investigation. \"It\\'s Kafkaesque,\" she says. \"You are not told who is accusing you. And you are not allowed to discuss it with anyone. So you receive this devastating letter – and are immediately isolated.\"\\n\\nFor legal reasons JVL is reluctant to discuss details but says a significant proportion of its committee is now under investigation by the party.\\n\\n\"The new Labour leadership is desperate to appear tough on antisemitism,\" says Manson. \"But there are really profound, deeply held differences of opinion here – inside the Jewish community as much as anywhere else,\" she says. \"You can\\'t just bludgeon people into silence.\"\\n\\nMargolyes agrees and finds the division within the Jewish community deeply distressing. Like many others involved in this debate she describes herself as \"firmly, inescapably Jewish. There is never a day goes by I don\\'t think about the Holocaust. I never get in the shower without thinking about the showers in the gas chambers. I never get on a train without thinking about the trains to the camps.\"\\n\\nShe says that she is only too aware of the traumas that created in many Jewish people a deep, deep desire for their own homeland. \"But I can\\'t blind myself to what this meant for the Palestinian people,\" she says. \"I have visited the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. I have seen the overcrowding, the filth, heard the nastiness of the Israeli guards. I know that this is wicked, unnecessary and cruel.\\n\\n\"For me, it\\'s not a political choice - it\\'s a moral imperative. I cannot allow things to be done in my name as a Jew which I know to be evil.

              " \"A senior British diplomat became involved in a plan to improve the image of Khalifa Haftar after the eastern Libyan commander was accused of committing war crimes.\\n\\nJolyon Welsh worked on the proposal after joining controversial public relations company Consulum while on unpaid leave from the UK Foreign Office.\\n\\nPreviously, Welsh served as the Foreign Office’s deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa.\\n\\nConsulum says it began work to devise a draft communications strategy on behalf of Haftar after being approached in early May 2019 by an intermediary for the commander, whom it declines to name.\\n\\nThe aim of the plan would have been to position Haftar as a credible leader of Libya as a whole, according to a Consulum document seen by MEE which the company describes as a “draft”.\\n\\nThe company says the proposal was abandoned after Welsh conducted a “due diligence” exercise to examine whether Haftar should be accepted as a client. The process appears to have taken the best part of a week during May 2019, despite the widespread international concern that Haftar was responsible for war crimes.\\n\\nThe previous month, UN officials had publicly warned Haftar that he could be committing war crimes by shelling civilians in Tripoli. Fatou Bensouda, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, also said that she was considering issuing arrest warrants.\\n\\nLibyan National Army forces loyal to Haftar on the outskirts of Tripoli in April 2019 (AFP/LNA War Information Div screengrab)\\n\\nAt the time, two ICC warrants were outstanding for the arrest of Mahmoud al-Werfalli, one of Haftar’s senior commanders. Al-Werfalli is still wanted for murder as a war crime.\\n\\nDuring June and July this year, following the collapse of Haftar’s assault on Tripoli, the bodies of men, women and children were found in mass graves and hospital morgues across territory that his forces previously controlled. More than 100 bodies recovered from a hospital morgue were said to bear signs of torture.\\n\\nAt the same time that Welsh was conducting his “due diligence” checks on Haftar, Consulum drew up the communications strategy document which – if the plan had not been abandoned – would have intended to help position Haftar as a future leader of the country by influencing first UK political and media opinion, then the wider western world.\\n\\nAsked about the document, Consulum’s lawyers disputed that the document indicated Consulum planned to pitch to work for Haftar, and threatened to sue for libel.\\n\\n'First draft'\\n\\nIn a series of subsequent letters to MEE, Consulum’s lawyers later conceded that the document was a “first draft” which could, after “many stages”, be developed into a more detailed proposal. It added that it had been drawn up by a junior employee and had never been used outside Consulum’s offices.\\n\\nConsulum also worked to generate favourable media coverage for its long-standing client, Saudi Arabia, notwithstanding the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018. Khashoggi is widely believed to have been killed on the orders of the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Consulum refuses to say whether or not Welsh was involved in its PR work for the kingdom.\\n\\nIn June, Consulum faced fierce criticism from the chair of the UK parliament’s foreign affairs committee for the public relations work it has agreed with the government of Hong Kong, after China imposed a new security law on the region.\\n\\nThis work was not only contrary to the interests of the British government, according to Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, but “against the interests of the British people, against the interests of democracy [and] against the interests of the rule of law”.\\n\\nA protester is detained by security forces in Hong Kong in October 2019 (AFP)\\n\\nShortly afterwards, the UK Foreign Office announced that Welsh was no longer a serving diplomat, but will not tell MEE when he left its service. Nor will the Foreign Office say whether it was aware that Welsh was working on the project.\\n\\nWelsh is understood to have joined Consulum in 2014, on a full-time basis. It is believed that at that time he was on unpaid leave, and remained a serving diplomat for several years.\\n\\nConsulum has also declined to say when Welsh left the Foreign Office, telling MEE that it believes the question to be of “no relevance”.\\n\\nHowever, the latest online version of Who’s Who, the volume of biographical data, says that Welsh remained a member of the UK Diplomatic Service when it was published in December 2019. Each entry in Who’s Who is written by the subject, on the basis of a questionnaire provided by the publisher.\\n\\nRebranding Haftar\\n\\nBy using a sophisticated communications strategy, lobbying government ministers, parliamentarians and journalists, and through the use of social media, Consulum’s document said it would have aimed to “position Field Marshal Haftar as essential to Libya’s future and the best chance for a stable, peaceful and united Libya aligned with the West’s interests”.\\n\\nThe ultimate objective according to the document would have been to present Haftar as “the only credible solution to Libya’s civil war”, and as a “pro-Western bulwark against terrorism” who could become the country’s “transitional leader” leader while it pursued a democratic future.\\n\\nA body is uncovered at a mass grave site in Tarhuna on 10 June 2020 (MEE)\\n\\nThe document suggested that Consulum could write a number of opinion pieces and place them in Western media, under Haftar’s byline; train his spokespeople; and make use of Google, Wikipedia and social media to boost Haftar’s online reputation.\\n\\nAs part of the draft strategy to position Haftar more favourably within the West, Consulum identified 22 UK government ministers, officials, parliamentarians and journalists which it described as “stakeholders”.\\n\\nThey included the then foreign and defence secretaries, Jeremy Hunt and Penny Mordaunt respectively; Lt Gen John Lorimer, the UK’s senior defence advisor on the Middle East; eight named journalists at six media organisations, including the BBC, The Times and The Economist; and four named MPs, including Tugendhat.\\n\\n'...UK support for Field Marshall [sic] Haftar could have a decisive impact in consolidating Western backing' - Consulum draft document\\n\\nThe document does not explain how Consulum proposed to persuade these individuals to support Haftar, but it does suggest that influencing UK opinion should be just the start of a strategy for the field marshal to gain “broad support across the Western political establishment”.\\n\\nThe document indicates that Consulum’s priority would have been to influence opinion in the UK and improve Haftar’s standing there.\\n\\nIt says: “This is because the UK is a permanent member of the UN Security Council; the UK remains an active player in the ongoing struggle in Libya; with the positions of other major Western countries, in particular the US and France, in flux, UK support for Field Marshall [sic] Haftar could have a decisive impact in consolidating Western backing.”\\n\\nConsulum proposed to do this by using a network of contacts in the international media, to bring about a global change in its perception of Haftar, according to the document.\\n\\nThe proposed strategy would have been implemented in conjunction with Haftar and his staff.\\n\\nConsulum’s proposed retainer for the work would have been between $200,000 and $250,000 a month.\\n\\nConsulum declined to answer a number of questions about the document, including who issued the instruction for the “junior employee” to create it; why Welsh’s “due diligence” checks appear to have taken so long; and whether the UK Foreign Office or any other government was consulted as part of these checks.\\n\\nSaudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on 12 January (Reuters)\\n\\nA spokesman for Consulum said: “Consulum has never acted for or agreed to act for Khalifa Haftar. In response to an unsolicited enquiry, having completed detailed due diligence, Consulum concluded that any engagement would be inappropriate.\\n\\n“Jolyon Welsh Has been a full-time employee of Consulum since 2014. His employment was entirely transparent and in full accordance with all relevant FCO rules and procedures and remains so.\\n\\n“Consulum is proud of its work, developing programmes that help countries and governments improve delivery, build capacity, promote economic outcomes and manage change. The company operates to the highest standard.”\\n\\nShortly after the Consulum document was created, a Texan lobbying company, Linden Government Solutions, announced that it had won a $2m contract to promote Haftar’s image.\\n\\nLinden told the US Justice Department, in filings required under the US Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), that it was providing “strategic consulting services, advice, planning … public relations services” and arranging meetings with business leaders and government officials.\\n\\nLinden and Haftar did not renew the contract when it expired in June 2020. Linden did not respond to MEE requests for comment.\\n\\nIn July, British parliamentarians, including a government minister, Grant Shapps, suggested that new legislation should be brought forward to create a UK version of FARA, after a parliamentary report concluded that UK ministers and intelligence agencies had failed to look into any Russian interference in the 2016 Brexit referendum. The UK Home Office says it is considering the idea.\\n\\n'Dark arts'\\n\\nConsulum was founded in 2012 by Tim Ryan and Matthew Gunther-Bushell, two former executives of the communications company Bell Pottinger.\\n\\nIn 2011, undercover reporters filmed other Bell Pottinger executives talking about their use of “dark arts”, and the work they had done for countries with questionable human rights records, such as Sri Lanka and Belarus. It is not suggested that Ryan or Gunther-Bushell were involved in these matters.\\n\\nIn 2017, Bell Pottinger went into administration after it was found to have been stirring up racial tensions in South Africa to further the business interests of one of the country’s most powerful families. Again, it is not suggested that either Ryan or Gunther-Bushell had anything to do with these matters.\\n\\nConsulum has offices in London and across the Gulf. It has worked closely with the Saudi government over the years to consider ways of generating more favourable media coverage.\\n\\nMEE has also seen a Consulum document which suggests a media strategy that could be deployed following the murder of Khashoggi.\\n\\nThis has included identifying the media organisations and individual journalists and commentators who are most favourable, and most hostile to the Saudi government.\\n\\nThis work is said to have included an audit of an “outlet and journalist database” and a “commentator and influencer database”, and included a series of recommendations for Saudi government ministries and the royal court.\",\n",

              " 'The explosion of a Syrian anti-aircraft missile in southern Israel on 22 April, followed by Israeli attacks around the northern city of Latakia on 5 May, were only the latest episodes of the shadow war that Israel and Iran have been fighting in war-ravaged Syria for several years. They will not be the last.\\n\\nNeither side wants these occasional flareups to grow into a fully fledged confrontation. But the risk of escalation is real due to potential miscalculations or technical errors in both sides’ attempts to achieve tactical gains.\\n\\nThe involvement of Hezbollah, Tehran’s most important non-state ally, in the Syrian theatre carries a further risk that comparatively low-level altercations in Syria may spill over into Lebanon and trigger a destructive conflict between the heavily armed Shia group and Israel.\\n\\nA more likely escalation scenario would be the killing of Hezbollah operatives embedded with Iran-backed militias in Syria, an event that could spill over into Lebanon\\n\\nThe current diplomatic re-engagement between the US and Iran is welcome, but it is unlikely to put an end to this shadow war, even if it leads to the successful revival of the 2015 nuclear deal. Both Tel Aviv and Tehran seek to secure their strategic positions in the post-Trump era, while a settlement for the Syrian conflict remains elusive.\\n\\nIsrael has conducted an initially covert, but increasingly open, campaign against what it sees as deepening Iranian entrenchment in Syria over the past decade. In what has become known in Israeli circles as the “campaign between wars”, the Israeli army has bombed Iranian-linked militias, weapons shipments to Hezbollah and Iranian military installations - in particular to the southwest of Damascus, but sometimes as far east as al-Bukamal on the Iraqi border and Masyaf in the north.\\n\\nMore recently, the Israeli army reportedly also targeted Iranian fuel shipments to Syria on the high seas, claiming that Iran uses these to smuggle weapons.\\n\\nSporadic retaliation\\n\\nIran and its allies, including the Syrian regime, have for the most part absorbed these strikes. They have only sporadically attempted to retaliate, namely when the attacks have caused major casualties. In May 2018, some 20 missiles launched from Syrian territory, which the Israeli army said were fired by the Iranian Quds Force, targeted Israeli military positions in the Golan Heights. The volley was likely a response to an Israeli attack on the Tiyas airbase near Homs a month earlier that killed at least seven Iranians.\\n\\nThe likelihood of Iranian casualties significantly decreased when Russia, which controls Syria’s airspace west of the Euphrates, obliged Israel to give prior notice of operations there, after one such operation led to the accidental downing of a Russian military aircraft by Syrian air defence, killing 15 Russian servicemen. It is generally assumed that the Russian military is passing on such information, giving the Iranians enough time to move their personnel out of harm’s way.\\n\\nHezbollah and Israel: Deterrence at the edge of destruction Read More »\\n\\nA more likely escalation scenario would be the killing of Hezbollah operatives embedded with Iran-backed militias in Syria, an event that could spill over into Lebanon. In August 2019, Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah explicitly vowed that such casualties would draw retaliation from Lebanon against Israel, raising the spectre of an all-out confrontation between the two sides.\\n\\nThe threat, which effectively aimed to expand the existing deterrence between Israel and Hezbollah to the Syrian theatre, came in the aftermath of an Israeli attack in Syria that killed two Hezbollah members, followed almost immediately by a drone attack in the southern suburbs of Beirut that allegedly targeted a key component of Hezbollah’s missile infrastructure. The response came exactly a week later, on 1 September 2019, when Hezbollah struck at and narrowly missed a military vehicle inside Israel.\\n\\nPrecarious balance of deterrence\\n\\nThis last chain of events in particular illustrates the danger that low-level altercations in Syria may upset the precarious balance of deterrence that has prevailed between Hezbollah and Israel since their 2006 war. Simply put, both players are aware that a new direct confrontation would incur intolerable damage to their own side, and are hence keen to avoid it.\\n\\nAt the same time, both also believe that credible deterrence is the safest way to avoid such a scenario, and that this requires signalling to the enemy their readiness to risk a confrontation if certain red lines are crossed. According to Israeli media, the Israeli army had stood ready to retaliate to Hezbollah’s 1 September response with a devastating blow. This would likely have prompted Hezbollah to respond yet again in kind. Israel called off the retaliatory strike once it became clear that none of its soldiers had been harmed.\\n\\nIsraeli soldiers stand near the Lebanese border in November 2020 (AFP)\\n\\nSince then, calm has mostly prevailed on the Lebanese-Israeli border, but this should not be taken for granted. On the surface, Hezbollah showed reluctance to deliver on Nasrallah’s commitment the last time one of its operatives, Ali Kamel Mohsin, was killed near Damascus last July.\\n\\nImmediately after that incident, the group claimed that Israel sent a message through the UN containing what amounted to an “apology” for the “unintentional” killing of Mohsin, which supporters cited as proof that Israel was “in a state of continued confusion and fear”.\\n\\nThe following month, Hezbollah vehemently denied Israeli claims of a botched border incursion, and quoted the heightened state of alert on Israel’s northern border as material proof that Hezbollah’s deterrence remained effective.\\n\\nUltimately, however, such rhetorical manoeuvring will not be enough. From the perspective of Hezbollah, standing down for too long would be read as a sign of weakness and encourage Israel to step up the pressure. By this logic, maintaining the balance of deterrence that has kept the border mostly quiet for the past 15 years would require real military action should Israel continue to carry out attacks against the group, whether in Lebanon or Syria.\\n\\nBracing for trouble\\n\\nThe Israeli military, for its part, is bracing for rough months ahead. According to its annual intelligence assessment published this past February, Hezbollah is moving towards a more aggressive posture, and is increasingly ready to risk limited confrontations along the border.\\n\\nOn 27 January, Israeli Army Chief of Staff Aviv Kochavi devoted some 10 minutes [27:30 to 38:30] of a 50-minute public presentation to explaining that in the event of such a conflict, it would be legitimate and necessary for the Israeli army to attack suspected weapons-storage and launching facilities embedded within densely populated residential areas in Lebanon - though he added that Israel would do so only after giving enough warning for civilians to evacuate.\\n\\nFrom the Iranian perspective, reinstating restrictions on its nuclear programme may appear as a significant concession that makes it necessary to reinforce other points of strength\\n\\nIsrael’s most influential think tank, the same one that hosted Kochavi’s speech, has argued for a more forward-leaning posture in Syria, and Israeli sources have fed alarming information to international media about an alleged build-up of Iranian capacity to store and produce advanced weapons in Syria, suggesting that Israel is preparing to step up its campaign there.\\n\\nWhile these reports partly reflect what is known about the current Iranian strategy for the proliferation of weapons to its allies, namely an increasing reliance on technology transfer that enables local manufacturing, it is not clear to what extent this represents a substantial increase or a qualitative shift in the threats that Israel has faced in recent years. For one, these reports stand in some contrast to previously reported assessments that Israeli attacks have gone a long way towards undermining Iran’s entrenchment in Syria.\\n\\nHezbollah, for its part, insists it aims for deterrence, and so far there are no indications to the contrary. Rather than a significant shift in the strategic balance, the most plausible reason for Israel’s increasingly bellicose posture appears to be the shift in the new US administration’s Iran policy - namely, the move away from the Trump-era “maximum pressure” on Iran to renewed diplomatic re-engagement and a return to the nuclear deal.\\n\\nDoomsday scenarios\\n\\nIsrael has made no secret of its misgivings about Washington’s new policy line, going as far as warning that it may send the region “spiralling into war”. Whether the current political and military leadership in Tel Aviv actually believes it will need to bring about such doomsday scenarios is unclear.\\n\\nOne objective behind emphasising the Iranian threat is certainly to urge the US to condition a return to the nuclear deal on addressing what Israel sees as Tehran’s problematic behaviour across the region - namely, its ballistic-missile programme, support for non-state actors, and, in the Israeli government’s eyes, undermining of regional security.\\n\\nWhile the Biden administration has sought to reassure its Israeli ally that it will eventually follow up on these issues, they are not on the agenda in the current Vienna talks. Nor is Tehran likely to reduce its footprint across the region and draw down its presence in theatres such as Syria of its own accord, once a deal is secured.\\n\\nFrom the Iranian perspective, reinstating restrictions on its nuclear programme may appear as a significant concession that makes it necessary to reinforce other points of strength in its strategic posture. During the Trump era, Iran’s strategy of asymmetric deterrence and defence through a conglomerate of state- and non-state actors proved effective against an impressive array of external adversaries endowed with far more resources and diplomatic clout.\\n\\nThe Iranian leadership may well opt to double down on this approach, not least to hedge against a possible return of the US to a more confrontational approach after the next US presidential election in 2024.\\n\\nMediating role\\n\\nIsrael may want to curtail the increasing margin of manoeuvre that the end of “maximum pressure” may award Iran by increasing pressure of its own in places such as Syria. If Iran were to respond violently, this could also serve to vindicate warnings against its nefarious intentions and convince Israel’s allies, in particular the US, to partner with Tel Aviv in containing Tehran.\\n\\nYet, with Russia ultimately calling the shots in Syria, and with Israel’s newfound Arab partners moving towards a more accommodating stance as well, there are clear limits to such an approach.\\n\\nThe likeliest scenario is that the jostling between Israel and Iran, and by extension Hezbollah, for position in the Syrian theatre will continue for the foreseeable future. In the meantime, the challenge will be to prevent occasional spikes of violence from spinning out of control.\\n\\nRussia, which maintains good contacts with all sides, appears best positioned for a mediating role, which it already performed in the run-up to the regime’s offensive to take back rebel-held areas along Syria’s border with Israel in June 2018.\\n\\nPreventing conflict in the triangle between Tel Aviv, Beirut and Tehran would be a smart move for Moscow to protect its political and military investment in Syria.\\n\\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.',\n",
              " 'Amid news of a potential Saudi-Iran rapprochement, media reports of a Saudi intelligence delegation in Damascus have received considerable coverage. A Rai al-Youm exclusive about Saudi Arabia’s intelligence chief meeting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has raised questions over the timing of the move.\\n\\nSuch discreet security visits tend not to be officially announced, leaving media reports uncorroborated - but in this instance, the Syrian ambassador to Lebanon issued a positive statement on the topic, which most Syrian officials have avoided since bilateral diplomatic relations were severed at the outset of the Syrian war.\\n\\nAs the Biden administration in the US seeks to recalibrate the unorthodox, Trump-era Middle East policies, the Saudis have been hedging their bets, uncertain over the future of Washington’s interests in Riyadh. The latest move by the Saudis also comes after the UAE and Bahrain publicly embraced the Assad regime in recent years.\\n\\nSaudi Arabia needs the assistance of Damascus in stabilising Lebanon, given that Beirut remains at the core of Saudi interests in the Levant\\n\\nEvents in Lebanon have also been a key factor, as Saudi Arabia needs the assistance of Damascus in stabilising Lebanon, given that Beirut remains at the core of Saudi interests in the Levant. Having exhausted all avenues of influence in Lebanon, Riyadh is now returning to the tried-and-tested formula of rapprochement with Syria.\\n\\nSaudi Arabia has been an active participant in Beirut’s politics ever since Ibn Saud’s opposition to further divisions of historical Syria. During the 1950s and ‘60s, the Saudis opposed further entrenchment of former Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser in Lebanon, instead favouring Syrian lordship over the country.\\n\\nAfter Hafez al-Assad came to power in Syria, the Saudis regularly favoured Syrian policies in Lebanon, even if that meant giving the upper hand to an ideological opponent. Despite clear strategic differences in how to stabilise Lebanon after Israel’s exit in 2000, Riyadh has repeatedly put aside its differences with Damascus and worked with Bashar al-Assad, just as it did with his father.\\n\\nRegaining prominence\\n\\nBasem Shabb, a former Lebanese MP and close adviser to Prime Minister-designate Saad Hariri, has written about how Syria has quietly upped its game in mainstream Lebanese politics, which has also meant supporting groups that back Syria rather than Iran’s main agenda in Lebanon. A US State Department assessment last year cited evidence that Damascus was regaining its pre-eminent place in Lebanese politics.\\n\\nIt is important to note that Syria has always pursued its own interests in Lebanon, rather than those of Iran. Syria does not always toe Iran’s line, especially with regards to Lebanon and Iraq. It is this aspect of Syria’s policy that appeals most to the Saudis.\\n\\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman chats with Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri in Mecca in 2019 (Bandar al-Jaloud/Saudi Royal Palace/AFP)\\n\\nThere is a saying in Damascus that the Saudis will try and fail in every Lebanese initiative until it consents and works with the Syrians, rather than against them. After the collapse of Lebanese banks and the Hariri detention fiasco, Riyadh had more or less written off Lebanon in its list of priorities. And yet, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has steadily but surely inched towards making Riyadh a player in Lebanon again.\\n\\nPrince Mohammed does not like being shut out and giving in to Iran in Lebanon. As such, he appears to be taking the same course as many of his predecessors, dating back to Ibn Saud: reaching out to Damascus for stability in Lebanon.\\n\\nDelicate balancing act\\n\\nOf course, the Saudi intelligence chief’s reported visit to Syria was not just about Lebanon. The Saudis have been reaching out to Damascus for years behind the scenes. Assad does not see the Saudi-Iran detente as a zero-sum game for Syria; like his father before him, who overcame Saudi suspicion of Syrian support for Iran against a then-Riyadh-allied Saddam Hussein, the Syrian president is poised to work with the Saudis again, regardless of the Iranian presence in Syria.\\n\\nSyria war: Will the Arab League welcome back Assad? Read More »\\n\\nThis delicate balancing act could draw in the Saudis to help Assad formally overcome his country’s economic breakdown. The UAE has publicly called for the removal of US Caesar Act sanctions, and is delivering regular medical aid and helping to facilitate Syria’s regional rehabilitation.\\n\\nDespite a public focus on Syria’s inclusion in the Arab League, this is merely symbolic. What matters are the actual policies that Damascus offers to the Saudis.\\n\\nPrince Mohammed has grand ideas that require the collective stability of Syria and Lebanon. Given the byzantine nature of Syrian and Lebanese politics, Saudi Arabia has room to manoeuvre, but must rely on the Syrians to re-enter Lebanon in a meaningful way.\\n\\nThe Saudi crown prince has made overtures to Assad and publicly called for an acknowledgement of Assad’s victory in return for pushing Iran out of Syria.

On social media, online campaigners have been sharing #SaveSheikhJarrah in a bid to garner international attention and to make sure the world bears witness to yet another Israeli crime.\\n\\nMake no mistake: an ethnic cleansing is currently underway in the predominantly Palestinian neighbourhood in full view of the world.\\n\\nBut in the American mainstream media, it is as if nothing is happening at all.\\n\\nIn this parallel universe, the illegal and vicious attempt to remove Palestinians from their homes, and the violent actions of Israeli forces to halt demonstrations against a recent court order upholding the evictions, have been met with a resounding silence.\\n\\nMultiple displacements\\n\\nA cursory glance at the New York Times, NPR, CNN and Time Magazine returned no results on the events of the past few days. Instead, they continue to focus primarily on Israel's inability to form a government. When the evictions and the violence inflicted on Sheikh Jarrah residents have been covered - for example, by the Associated Press - the issue is framed as a quasi commercial dispute between two parties and described as a “long-running legal battle” between Palestinians and settlers, conveniently neglecting to note that under international law, Israeli courts do not have the authority to settle civilians in occupied Palestinian territory, while the displacement of Palestinian families contravenes the fundamentals of international humanitarian law.\\n\\nIsraeli settler’s attempt to justify forcible takeover of a Palestinian home sparks online anger Read More »\\n\\nAs the longtime attacks on families in the neighbourhood would attest, the story in Sheikh Jarrah goes to the heart of the never-ending Israeli project of settler-colonialism of the land and expulsion of Palestinians, or as Palestinians have described it: a continuation of the Nakba of 1948.\\n\\nThe neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah comprises some 3,000 refugees who were forcibly displaced from their original homes in other parts of what was historic Palestine in 1948. Since the early 1970s, Palestinians in the neighbourhood have been battling a series of Jewish settler organisations who filed lawsuits claiming the land belonged to them. Dozens of Palestinians have been kicked out of the neighbourhood and replaced by Israeli settlers.\\n\\nThe current impasse and protests came about after Israeli courts last year ordered the eviction of more than a dozen Palestinian families from the residential neighbourhood.\\n\\nConsidering the ways in which the mainstream US media has historically covered the Israeli occupation of Palestine - be it the use of the term “clashes,” even when Israeli mobs have marched to the chant of “Death to Arabs,” as they did last month, or the drawing of false equivalences in the levels of violence between occupier and occupied, or the constant justification of Israeli violence as “self-defence,” even in the thick of an invasion - the lack of coverage of the events in Sheikh Jarrah is not altogether surprising.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is the same media after all that still chooses to laud Israel’s Covid-19 vaccine success while it completely negates its legal responsibilites towards the lives of Palestinians living under its control.\\n\\nNabil al-Kurd, a longtime resident of Karm al-Jaouni, stands next to a wall graffitied with “We will not leave” in Arabic (MEE/Aseel Jundi)\\n\\nThe erasure of the events in Sheikh Jarrah, though, is still jarring.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne would have thought that given the tumultuous events of the past year - from the Black Lives Matter movement to the Covid-19 pandemic which exposed a decrepit, unequal America - that US mainstream media would have shifted gears, rethinking their own complicity, or at least exploring American duplicity.\\n\\nBut they apparently remain unmoved.\\n\\nOfficial silence\\n\\nPart of the problem is that there is no one to hold Israel to account. Palestinian civil society activists have called upon the International Criminal Court to include the evictions in Sheikh Jarrah as part of its ongoing investigations, but both Israel and the US have rejected the ICC’s right to hold Israel to account.\\n\\nJerusalem is ready to explode - the world can't say it wasn't warned Read More »\\n\\nOn Sheikh Jarrah, the US government has refused to condemn the state-sponsored actions of the settlers. On Wednesday, numerous American lawmakers called on the State Department to break their silence. Representative Marie Newman, for instance, demanded that the State Department “immediately condemn these violations of international law as Palestinians are forcibly being removed from their homes in East Jerusalem”.\\n\\nOn Thursday, a spokesperson for State Department told Middle East Eye it was “deeply concerned”.\\n\\n“As we have consistently said, it is critical to avoid unilateral steps that exacerbate tensions or take us further away from peace, this includes evictions, settlement activity and home demolitions,” the spokesperson added.\\n\\nThe United Nations has been equally pallid on the matter. Its leadership, too, has shown itself barely capable of reiterating its oft-repeated position that “all settlement activities, including the evictions and demolitions, are illegal under international law”.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the facts on the ground continue to change. Today, tomorrow, the evictions will continue; more lives destroyed, more homes taken over. And it seems the US mainstream media is well aware that if there are no consequences for displacing and expelling Palestinians from their homes, there are surely no consequences for the media to erase these crimes.\\n\\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.\",\n",

In 2006, William Hague, then the shadow foreign secretary, used the term “disproportionate” about the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. His remarks were followed by protests and an alleged threat to withdraw Tory funding from Lord Kalms, an important donor and member of the Conservative Friends of Israel.\\n\\nTo the best of my knowledge - and I will happily correct this if I am wrong - no senior Tory has ever used that phrase again.

According to the United Nations, the Israeli military killed 214 Palestinians - 46 of them children - in the context of the Great March, and injured more than 36,100. “During the same period,” by contrast, “one Israeli soldier was killed and seven others were injured.”\\n\\nThe media takeaway from the same event: there were \"clashes\".\\n\\nPreferred vocabulary\\n\\nNow, Israel\\'s ethnic cleansing operations in occupied East Jerusalem have provided news outlets with another opportunity to exercise their preferred vocabulary - insofar as they can be bothered to report on the events at all.\\n\\nForty Palestinians, including ten children, currently face eviction from their homes in East Jerusalem’s Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood to make way for more incoming right-wing settlers - the latest round in a decades-long Israeli campaign of forced re-displacement of Palestinian refugee families from 1948.\\n\\nSheikh Jarrah explained: The past and present of East Jerusalem neighbourhood Read More »\\n\\nAs if the injustice were not already epic enough, Israeli police have responded to protesters in Sheikh Jarrah by, inter alia, charging them on horseback and dousing the area with tear gas and skunk water - a delightful Israeli invention that has been described as \"worse than raw sewage\" and \"like a mixture of excrement, noxious gas and a decomposing donkey\".\\n\\nOn top of that, Israeli security forces have assaulted Palestinian worshippers at Al-Aqsa Mosque, firing rubber-coated metal bullets and stun grenades and injuring hundreds.\\n\\nBut for the media, it’s all in a day’s \"scuffle\". There were \"scuffles\" and \"clashes\" galore in the Washington Post, on the ABC News website, in the Guardian, at Fox News, and again at the Post.\\n\\nThe BBC, for its part, has dutifully kept its audience updated about “clashes” and “confrontations”- while insisting that, in firing stun grenades and the like, Israeli police have simply been acting “in response” to Palestinian provocations (just as Israel is always acting “in response” when it, like, slaughters thousands of people in Gaza).\\n\\nA New York Times article published on 7 May on Israeli police \"confrontations with Palestinian protesters\" meanwhile noted that “the Israeli Foreign Ministry said the Palestinian Authority and Palestinian terrorists were ‘presenting a real-estate dispute between private parties as a nationalistic cause in order to incite violence in Jerusalem’”.\\n\\nIn actuality, of course, the whole Israeli-Palestinian \"conflict\" is Sheikh Jarrah writ large: a \"real-estate dispute\" in which the party that violently usurped the bulk of Palestinian real estate in 1948 - and that continues to illegally occupy the rest - must cast Palestinians as terrorists in order to justify terrorising, killing and expelling them (pardon, “clashing” with them).\\n\\nHypocrisy and deceit\\n\\nFrom the get-go, the success of the Israeli enterprise was predicated on a policy of ethnic cleansing - the same policy now playing out in Sheikh Jarrah. But it is not the function of the New York Times and like-minded publications to connect the historical dots and thereby provide a contextualised picture of systematic Israeli dispossession of Palestinians, as opposed to localised “confrontations”.\\n\\nIn actuality, of course, the whole Israeli-Palestinian \\'conflict\\' is Sheikh Jarrah writ large\\n\\nFurthermore, by quoting patently ludicrous Israeli foreign ministry statements without making it clear that they are patently ludicrous, the Times is merely assisting in the propagation of the Israeli narrative and the normalisation of occupation.\\n\\nImagine for a moment that, say, the foreign ministry of Guatemala issued a statement claiming that coronavirus was transmitted by unicorns.

              " 'In the early 1960s, while recently decolonised countries in Asia and Africa mounted a vigorous attack against South African apartheid, seeking to isolate the white supremacist settler-colonial regime, white European liberals and socialists were celebrating the achievement of Jewish supremacism in Israel.\\n\\nThrough the Council of the Socialist International, white European socialists met in Israel in 1960 and endorsed national self-determination for colonised peoples. They declared from the bosom of the racist Jewish settler-colony in Haifa, without a whiff of irony, that for \"multi-racial communities … no solution is possible if it is based on any form of racial discrimination, either by the minority over the majority or vice versa”.\\n\\nAt the time, Israel had caged what remained of the indigenous Palestinian population, the majority of whom it had expelled during the 1948 war, in their remaining towns and villages under draconian martial law and Emergency Regulations, with racist pass laws to restrict them to their reserves, while confiscating their land and property and transferring it for the exclusive use of Jews.\\n\\nNeither Israel\\'s Jewish supremacy nor its apartheid crimes began with the nation state law, which simply added more legal instruments to the country\\'s decades-old institutional and colonial racism\\n\\nAnalogising Israeli Jewish supremacy and settler-colonialism in Palestine to South African apartheid had become standard practice by Asians and Africans at least since the 1960s.\\n\\nFormer Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat made the comparison explicit at his 1974 inaugural speech at the United Nations in New York: “The roots of the Palestinian question reach back into the closing years of the nineteenth century; in other words, to that period we call the era of colonialism and settlement as we know it today … This period persists into the present. Marked evidence of its totally reprehensible presence can be readily perceived in the racism practised both in South Africa and in Palestine.”\\n\\nWhen the UN General Assembly equated Zionism with racism in 1975 in Resolution 3379, the international community only declared what everyone, except white European and American imperialists - liberals and conservatives alike - knew to be true: Zionism, the UN proclaimed, was “a form of racism and racial discrimination”, and they grouped it with the settler-colonial racism of South Africa and Rhodesia (later Zimbabwe). The vast majority of the 35 “nay” voters were European settler-colonies in the Americas and Oceania, and European colonial countries.\\n\\nSouth African apartheid analogy\\n\\nIn academic and history books, the analogy has been drawn regularly. Palestinian scholar Fayez Sayegh identified Zionist racism as akin to apartheid South Africa in his 1965 book Zionist Colonialism in Palestine. British journalist David Hirst wrote of “apartheid Israeli-style” in his 1977 book The Gun and the Olive Branch. Edward Said described Israeli Jewish racist and colonial practices against Palestinians as “de facto apartheid” throughout his 1979 classic The Question of Palestine.\\n\\nHow can anyone look at what is happening in Sheikh Jarrah and not view it as racist colonization? How can anyone continue to believe Israel is some liberal paradise after this? Why were these kind of policies condemnable in South Africa yet totally normalized in Palestine-Israel? — Edo Konrad (@edokonrad) May 5, 2021\\n\\nBy the 1980s, except for white European and American liberal and conservative racists committed to Jewish settler-colonialism, the apartheid analogy was everywhere. After the fall of apartheid in South Africa in 1994, anti-apartheid leaders, from Nelson Mandela to Desmond Tutu, expressed horror at Israeli policies, and several African National Congress visitors to Israeli-occupied Palestine described Israel’s treatment of Palestinians as “worse than apartheid”.\\n\\nNone of this moved the majority of white European and American liberal apologists for Israel, as the judgment of Asians and Africans remained subjective and of no consequence to them, with objectivity remaining an exclusive possession of white people. As Frantz Fanon averred in the early 1960s: “For the native, objectivity is always directed against him.”\\n\\nBy the dawn of the 21st century, white European and US liberals and conservatives were jumping to defend Israel against this “hideous” analogy. In 2001, at the World Conference Against Racism in Durban, South Africa, the coopted white establishment African American then-Secretary of State Colin Powell led a walkout of the US delegation in protest over delegates calling Israel an apartheid state, which he unashamedly described as “hateful language”.\\n\\nPalestinians queue at the Bethlehem checkpoint in the occupied West Bank on 30 April 2021 (AFP)\\n\\nWhen US-based faculty and students demanded in 2002 that universities divest from companies that supported Israel’s occupation and apartheid policies, Abraham Foxman, then-head of the Anti-Defamation League, called the analogy to South African apartheid “hideous”. When faculty and students at Columbia University, including myself, made similar demands, the school’s president called the reference to Israeli apartheid “both grotesque and offensive”.\\n\\nBelated decision\\n\\nPalestinian human rights groups and the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement have been calling Israel an apartheid state for more than a decade and a half, and students in solidarity with Palestinians in the US, Canada and Europe started Israel Apartheid Week in 2005 to expose Israel’s apartheid policies on university campuses. They are often harassed and harangued by apologists for Israel’s racism, both students and university administrators.\\n\\nOnly this past January, almost 73 years since the establishment of Israel, did the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem issue a report identifying the Israeli regime as one of “Jewish supremacy” and Israel as an apartheid state (another Israeli human rights group, Yesh Din, issued a report last year describing Israel’s rule in the occupied territories as “apartheid”).\\n\\nWhy calling Israel an apartheid state is not enough Read More »\\n\\nThe B’Tselem report was not based on some new reality that suddenly transformed Israel into an apartheid, Jewish supremacist state, but rather on the group’s belated decision to acknowledge that “the terms we have used in recent years to describe the situation … are no longer adequate”. Thus, the terms that Palestinians and mostly non-white others have recognised for decades - “apartheid” and “Jewish supremacy” - were suddenly the only appropriate terms for B’Tselem to use to describe the Israeli regime.\\n\\nOf course, Israeli racism has not abated in recent years, with Israel’s 2018 nation-state law being the most recent of its dozens of racist laws enacted since 1948. But neither Israel’s Jewish supremacy nor its apartheid crimes began with that law, which simply added more legal instruments to the country’s decades-old institutional and colonial racism.\\n\\nNow that a respected Ashkenazi-Jewish Israeli organisation had given its blessing to the use of these terms, the white-dominated US-based organisation Human Rights Watch (HRW) felt it was time that it, too, identified Israeli apartheid. Like B’Tselem, HRW did not base its recent decision to accuse Israel of “crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution” on some recent Israeli policy, but rather acknowledged that this is what Israel has always been.\\n\\nAn Israeli soldier stands guard at the Qalandia checkpoint near a mural of late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on 30 April 2021 (AFP)\\n\\nIts report explicitly states: “Israel has maintained military rule over some portion of the Palestinian population for all but six months of its 73-year history. It did so over the vast majority of Palestinians inside Israel from 1948 and until 1966. From 1967 until the present, it has militarily ruled over Palestinians in the OPT, excluding East Jerusalem. By contrast, it has since its founding governed all Jewish Israelis, including settlers in the OPT since the beginning of the occupation in 1967, under its more rights-respecting civil law.”\\n\\nWhat HRW says is the novelty in its report is that its charge that Israel commits apartheid and persecution is based on a “legal analysis” in line with international law definitions. HRW is careful to clarify that it is not comparing Israel to apartheid South Africa or charging Israel with being an “apartheid state”, as this concept is “not defined in international law”.\\n\\nInternational law violations\\n\\nIn fact, the Palestinian group Adalah has long documented dozens of discriminatory Israeli laws that privilege Jews, operative since the establishment of the settler colony in 1948. Indeed, these laws have always been listed in Palestinian scholarship on the subject. Sabri Jiryis’s 1970s classic The Arabs in Israel explained the discriminatory and racist effectiveness of these laws in subjecting Palestinians to Jewish supremacy.\\n\\nIsrael’s numerous violations of international law have been a constant refrain at the UN since the country’s establishment in 1948, with many General Assembly and Security Council resolutions condemning it for the very same practices that groups such as HRW and B’Tselem now recognise as crimes against humanity.\\n\\nThese groups failed to acknowledge their own racism and complicity with Israeli apartheid over the decades, when they insisted on being blind to Israeli apartheid while it was in plain sight\\n\\nThis is not the first time that the “international community” (read: white western countries and their liberal intelligentsia) has insisted on waiting for Ashkenazi Israeli Jews to confirm what Palestinians had been saying all along before the claim was believed, let alone endorsed.\\n\\nA prime example is the Zionist expulsion of 85 percent of the Palestinian people from their homeland in the 1947-48 period, denied by Israel and its apologists in the West for decades despite the huge body of evidence presented by the international press, the UN, the Red Cross and Palestinian scholars since 1948.\\n\\nOnly when in the 1980s, an Ashkenazi Israeli Zionist historian referenced official Israeli documents that spoke of the scale of the expulsion and massacres, did the pro-Israel western intelligentsia reluctantly relent years later - and even then, only partially, replacing its claim that the refugees “fled” on their own, to the claim that refugees “fled or were driven out”, to soften the impact of Israel’s crimes.\\n\\nWhat B’Tselem and HRW pronounced in their recent reports was only news to liberal Israeli Jews and the liberal white US and European intelligentsia whose commitment to Jewish settler-colonialism in Palestine has never wavered.\\n\\nSuch pronouncements, however, should not provoke appreciation or acknowledgment by Palestinians and their supporters; rather, they must elicit condemnation of these racist Israeli and western human rights groups who, in their recent reports, failed to acknowledge their own racism and complicity with Israeli apartheid over the decades, when they insisted on being blind to Israeli apartheid while it was in plain sight.\\n\\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.',\n",
              " 'Late last month, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman gave a wide-ranging, 90-minute interview on the state-owned Rotana channel with host Abdullah al-Mudaifer. The crown prince gave detailed accounts of his achievements thus far and what remains to be done. Particularly impressive were his claims on the improved efficiency of Saudi government ministries and agencies.\\n\\nNo reasonable person would disagree with the premise that the Saudi state needs radical administrative reforms to allow it to efficiently execute government policy. Prince Mohammed also spoke about religious policy in the reforms he envisions, reaffirming the basic constitutional structure of the kingdom as resting in the Quran, the sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad, and the kingdom’s Basic Law.\\n\\nIn the course of explaining the country’s future religious policy, however, the crown prince said two things that probably surprised the Saudi religious establishment.\\n\\nMany would like to see a much more fulsome renunciation of those doctrines that make coexistence with the \\'Other\\' - both Muslim and non-Muslim - impossible\\n\\nFirstly, he said that the Saudi constitutional system, while bound by the sunnah of the Prophet, only recognises as constitutionally binding those texts of hadiths (reports) that are considered mutawatir. A hadith of the Prophet is considered mutawatir only if it was reported by such a large number of transmitters across generations that it is inconceivable it could have been fabricated. In other words, the hadith needs to have been transmitted on the same scale as the Quran, the transmission of which, everyone agrees, satisfies this stringent requirement. Otherwise, in the case of hadiths that do not rise to this level of certainty, the government will only apply them to the extent that they are consistent with the well-being of the people of Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nThe second statement that surely raised the ire of the religious establishment was Prince Mohammed’s disavowal of any loyalty to Wahhabism. Without denouncing Wahhabism as such, the crown prince asserted that it is contrary to Islamic monotheism - which does not recognise any intermediaries between people and God - to endow the views of any particular person with a special status. He went so far as to say that if the founder of Wahhabism were alive today, he would have been the first to reject the notion that his ideas should be taken unquestioningly.\\n\\nThe centrality of intention\\n\\nBoth propositions - while they might seem quite limited from the perspective of someone unfamiliar with the doctrines of Islamic jurisprudence and theology - are potentially quite revolutionary. At the same time, they might not mean very much.\\n\\nWhen the crown prince speaks of being bound only by those hadiths whose transmission was as widespread as the Quran, he is essentially speaking of a null set: no individual hadith has been so widely transmitted that it is comparable to the Quran. For that reason, jurists have distinguished between two kinds of mass-transmitted texts: one whose wording (lafz) was mass transmitted, and one whose meaning (ma\\'na) was widely transmitted.\\n\\nSaudi worshippers wearing face masks to prevent the spread of Covid-19 walk at the al-Rajhi mosque in the Riyadh, on 31 August, 2020 (AFP)\\n\\nTo give a simple example, every Muslim is taught the hadith: “Deeds are judged only by their intentions.” This is not a mass-transmitted hadith in terms of wording. It was transmitted by only one companion, and then by only one person of the next generation. It only became widespread or famous in the third generation and thereafter.\\n\\nBut that only refers to its particular wording. Countless hadiths and verses of the Quran corroborate the centrality of intention to Muslim ethics. Accordingly, jurists say that this particular hadith, with respect to its wording, is a solitary hadith, and therefore can only be given probable attribution to the Prophet, while its meaning - being widely corroborated through scores of other texts - is certain.\\n\\nWithout clarifying whether the Saudi state claims to be bound only by hadith texts whose wording, as opposed to meaning, is mass transmitted, the crown prince could either mean that the sunnah has effectively lost any role in the Saudi constitutional order, or that only those foundational principles of the sunnah whose meanings are essentially incontrovertible are constitutionally binding.\\n\\nThe problem with Wahhabism\\n\\nThis leads to the next ambiguity in his response to the relationship of the Saudi state to Wahhabism. Wahhabism was not, in the first instance, a legal movement, but rather a theological movement dedicated to what it understood to be a pure and uncompromising monotheism.\\n\\nAmong its most destructive consequences was its tendency to transform every disagreement, no matter how seemingly small, into a matter of faith and disbelief. This is because Wahhabists believed that a failure to give proper weight to religious texts - as they understood them - amounted to rejecting divine sovereignty and was tantamount to unbelief.\\n\\nMohammed bin Salman\\'s Saudi TV interview exposes empty promises Read More »\\n\\nOn this basis, Wahhabists anathematised the vast majority of the Muslim world. They also adopted a rigorous doctrine of “loyalty and disavowal” (al-walāʾ wa’l-barāʾ), whose followers not only have an affirmative duty to display contempt toward unbelievers (now defined to include much of the Muslim world) but also had the same duty toward Muslims who failed to display sufficient intolerance of unbelief.\\n\\nIt was the principled and rigorous intolerance of the Wahhabi movement that created much havoc in the Muslim world. If the Saudi government truly wishes to turn the page on Wahhabism, it must be more forthright in distancing itself from the doctrine that makes even intra-Muslim pluralism inconceivable, to say nothing of inter-religious pluralism.\\n\\nWhile the crown prince’s statement disestablishing Wahhabism, if carried out, is no doubt welcome, many would like to see a much more fulsome renunciation of those doctrines that make coexistence with the “Other” - both Muslim and non-Muslim - impossible.\\n\\nA modern vision\\n\\nFinally, there is no small irony in the crown prince staking out a religious programme that seeks to limit dogmatic adherence to every prophetic report in favour of the public interest, and to promote space for personal rights and toleration. Muslim modernists have articulated this vision for more than a century, with a fundamental difference: hand-in-hand with calling for a pruning of what constitutes \"religion\", they have also called for greater public participation in government through democracy.\\n\\nDespotic Arab states have been willing to accept their religious arguments, while assiduously refusing to implement their calls for democratisation. Indeed, many of the scholars most interested in the kinds of religious reforms referenced by the crown prince are either in jail or accused of supporting terrorism, precisely because they also insist on the political programme of Muslim modernism.\\n\\nUltimately, we will only be able to take seriously these calls when Prince Mohammed recognises the right of Muslims to rule themselves politically\\n\\nIn this respect, Prince Mohammed’s approach to government is no different from that of other modern Arab leaders: seeking social reforms without providing space for public participation in government.\\n\\nWhat he does not seem to realise is that his dream of a modern, efficient Saudi state that leads its people to prosperity can be achieved only through the active participation of Saudi citizens. Even though he acknowledges that Vision 2030 can succeed only if Saudi citizens embrace the plan, he fails to recognise the crucial role that democratic institutions play in producing the type of social consensus required to implement a transformative vision.\\n\\nThe kind of independent thought the crown prince is calling for in matters of religion - and which Muslim modernists, such as Rashid Rida, were the first to call for and who saw in the kingdom a place where such a renewal could take place - is incompatible with the crown prince’s despotic style of rule.\\n\\nUltimately, we will only be able to take seriously these calls when Prince Mohammed recognises the right of Muslims to rule themselves politically.\\n\\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.\\n\\nThis article is available in French on Middle East Eye French edition.',\n",
              " 'Barely a month has passed since Jared Kushner, former US President Donald Trump\\'s son-in-law and Middle East envoy, declared the Arab-Israeli conflict over.\\n\\nWriting in the Wall Street Journal, Kushner declared that \"the political earthquake\" unleashed by the latest wave of Arab normalisations with Israel wasn’t over. Indeed, Kushner enthused, more than 130,000 Israelis had already visited Dubai since Trump hosted the signing of the Abraham Accords last September.\\n\\nEven among secular nationalists, Kushner is by no means alone in thinking that the seven-decade old conflict is over bar the shouting\\n\\nNew friendly relations were flowering between Jews and Arabs. Just wait for the direct flights between Morocco and Israel. Saudi Arabia would soon be next. \"We are witnessing the last vestiges of what has been known as the Arab-Israeli conflict,\" Kushner wrote triumphantly.\\n\\nNo US figure has written anything so arrogant and been so wrong since President George W Bush landed on an aircraft carrier after the invasion of Iraq sporting the fateful banner: \"Mission Accomplished\". It was a claim Iraqi IEDs made US coalition soldiers swallow for many years thereafter.\\n\\nKushner regrets nothing. He knows he is right, because he has God on his side. But even among secular nationalists, Kushner is by no means alone in thinking that the seven-decade old conflict is over bar the shouting.\\n\\nMinority rule\\n\\nTo be Israeli is to notch up one territorial victory after another - the Golan Heights, East Jerusalem, the settlements around it, the Jordan Valley. Each year the state of Israel expands to inhabit a little bit more of the Land of Israel, the traditional Jewish name for territory that stretches far beyond the 1967 borders.\\n\\nJerusalem protests: Palestine\\'s new generation rises up Read More »\\n\\nIsrael has long since established itself as the only state between the river and the sea, one increasingly incapable of tolerating any other political identity alongside it. This is their solution to the conflict, where the Jewish minority rules over an Arab majority.\\n\\nTo be Palestinian is to receive one blow after another - America’s acceptance of Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel; a new president in the White House who once said that if Israel did not exist, the US would have to invent it; the headlong rush to invest in, and trade with, Israel - even by Arab countries which have yet to recognise it.\\n\\nTheir own leadership is isolated and hopelessly divided. On Thursday, Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, officially postponed the first elections in 15 years. Israel’s refusal to allow Jerusalemites to vote was the pretext for this. \"As soon as Israel agrees [to let Palestinians vote in Jerusalem], we’ll hold the election within a week,\" Abbas said in a televised speech. But, as everyone knows, the cause of this indefinite delay resides in the certain blow Abbas would receive if he did go to the polls. His party, Fatah, has split into three lists, of which the list he heads is the least popular. Abbas’s search for a popular mandate is looking increasingly troubled.\\n\\nSo this is what the end of conflict looks like. It\\'s only a matter of time before the Palestinians see that their best interest lies in giving up, Kushner and the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calculate. Besides, the Palestinians already have a state of their own. It\\'s called Jordan.\\n\\nIn victory, the peril is greatest\\n\\nAll of which is dangerous make-believe. The project to establish Israel as a Jewish state has never been in more peril than it is now, when it thinks it is on the cusp of victory. For the real earthquake rumbling is not the one that signals an end of conflict, nor is it rumbling in the West Bank or Gaza. It is shaking Israel, in Jerusalem and in the territory it took in 1948.\\n\\nThe real earthquake rumbling is not the one that signals an end of conflict, nor is it rumbling in West Bank or Gaza. It is shaking Israel, in Jerusalem and in the territory it took in 1948\\n\\nIt is between the Palestinians - who are either Israeli citizens or Jerusalemites - and the state itself, and it has Jerusalem at its centre. No wall or checkpoint will protect Israel from its consequences.\\n\\nThe following exchange between a Palestinian protester and a Jewish TV reporter was recorded in front of the Damascus Gate in the Old City of Jerusalem recently. \"Where was your grandfather born?\" asks the Palestinian. \"Where my grandfather was born? In Morocco,\" replied the Mizrahi presenter. \"Not in this land, right? He was not here. And he did not come here before, right?\"\\n\\n\"So, what do you mean?\" \"As for me, my grandfather and his father were born here.\" \"Do I have to return to Morocco? Is this what you mean?\" The Palestinian answered: \"This land is not for you... this land is not yours. Jerusalem is ours and it is Islamic.\"\\n\\nPalestinian protesters raise national flags as they gather near the Damascus Gate in Jerusalem\\'s Old City, on 25 April, 2021 (AFP)\\n\\nThe spark for the confrontation was the decision to ban Palestinians from sitting in the courtyard and stairs in front of Damascus Gate, where Palestinians used to sit after prayers at Al-Aqsa Mosque. The reason for the continued closure this year was Covid-19, but this provoked outage. \"Did they perform the closure when there was Purim and Passover for the Jews? They must open the courtyard and stairs for us,\" the demonstrators demanded.\\n\\nEthnic cleansing campaign\\n\\nThere are many more serious threats to their way of life, but the attempted closure of this area appeared to be the last straw. Jerusalemites face an organised campaign of ethnic cleansing. They are either being forced to destroy houses built without planning permission, or they face expulsion from their homes. A fresh round of expulsions is set to take place in Sheikh Jarrah on 2 May, which could prove to be another spark for mass protest.\\n\\nPalestinians can now see their stolen property in the database we\\'ve made public Read More »\\n\\nOver on the coast in Jaffa, confrontations between Palestinians and Israelis have another cause: the sale of so-called absentee properties to settlers. These are the properties in Jaffa whose Arab owners fled during the Nakba in 1948 and which are now occupied by Palestinian tenants with lifetime tenancy.\\n\\nIn 1948, the newly formed state of Israel expropriated these properties in Jaffa, which at the time constituted 25 percent of all the real estate in the country. For three years, Amidar, the Israeli state-owned housing company, has offered tenants the right to buy, but at prices they can not afford.\\n\\nThe sale has created an instant flashpoint. For weeks now, Palestinians in Jaffa have been gathering to demonstrate. Graffiti proclaiming \"Jaffa is not for sale\" has gone up in Arabic and Hebrew. The clear intention is to replace the city’s Arab population with Jewish setters.\\n\\nClashes between police, settlers and Jaffa\\'s Palestinians took place after two Palestinians from the al-Jarbo family, who are facing evictions from a residential building in the al-Ajami neighbourhood, reportedly assaulted the director of a Yeshiva, Rabbi Eliyahu Mali, as he attempted to view the property. Amidar is planning to expel Palestinian residents of the property and sell it to the rabbi, who wants to turn it into a synagogue.\\n\\nOver in the northern city of Umm al Fahm, and other Arab towns in the Northern Triangle and Galilee, there is yet another cause of protest. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have demonstrated against police inaction over armed gang violence for eight Fridays in a row. In each of these protests, the Palestinian flag has re-emerged. The chants are against the occupation, and yet this is all happening within the 1948 borders of Israel itself.\\n\\nAnd so the mass chants go: \"Greetings from Umm Al-Fahm to our proud Jerusalem. O Zionist... can you hear? Closing the roads is on the way. Time revolves... and after night there will be day. From beneath the rubbles we rise... from beneath the destruction we are reborn. Paradise, paradise, paradise… remain safe O our homeland. Greetings from Um Al-Fahm to our proud Jerusalem.”\\n\\nA new generation\\n\\nThe protesters are young, fearless and leaderless. Neither Fatah nor Hamas hold any sway here. All think of themselves not as citizens of Israel, but as Palestinians whose land and rights have been taken over by the Israeli state. They chant national Palestinian slogans.\\n\\nThe protesters are young, fearless, and leaderless. All think of themselves not as citizens of Israel, but as Palestinians whose land and rights have been taken over by the Israeli state\\n\\nMeanwhile in the Negev in the south, Israeli bulldozers have achieved something of a record. They have destroyed the same village, al-Araqib, for the 186th time. The tension is a nationwide phenomenon. It is in the north, south, east and west. The epicentre of this spreading revolt is not Umm al Fahm or Jaffa. It is Jerusalem. Every dawn buses bring people from Palestinian towns from within 1948 borders to pray. They are called \"Al-Murabitun\", the protectors of Al-Aqsa.\\n\\nThe chant from Shafa Amr: \"O Jerusalem do not shake... you are full of Arabism and might.\" From Jerusalem: “Forget about peacefulness… we want stones and rockets. O Aqsa we have come... and the police will not deter us.\"\\n\\nThese protestors are not uniformly motivated by religion nor are most of them socially conservative. Piece by piece, a national protest movement is forming, just as the First Intifada did, but this time it is not happening in the West Bank or Gaza but within Jerusalem and the 1948 borders of Israel itself.\\n\\nA new generation is rediscovering the need to take to the streets. And a new axis is being formed. It is not pointing eastwards from Jerusalem to Ramallah, but west from Jerusalem to Jaffa. The security forces in Israel do not know how to react. According to Israeli daily Yedioth Aharonoth, there is dissension between various branches of the security forces on how to react.\\n\\nSenior officials within the army and the intelligence services, the newspaper reported, have expressed “a professional disappointment in the conduct of the police within Jerusalem during the recent confrontations, for there was no sufficient preparation and dealing with the early events provoked emotions.”\\n\\nThe paper said that the intelligence services warned the police against closing the stairs leading to Bab al-Amoud \"because of the explosion it would cause in the region\". The authorities gave way on the closure of the space in front of the Damascus Gate, to wild celebrations.\\n\\nOn the brink\\n\\nThere is fuel in the air. It will not take long before it finds another spark. Jerusalem is on the brink of an explosion.\\n\\nAre Israel’s international allies going to sit back and await the death and bloodshed that would inevitably accompany a fresh uprising? Joe Biden has embarked on a bid to restore US leadership by staking out a foreign policy allegedly based on support for human rights. His administration is the first in US history to recognise the Armenian genocide.\\n\\nAre Israel’s international allies going to sit back and await the death and bloodshed which would inevitably accompany a fresh uprising?\\n\\nBut if Biden actually wants to make a difference, it is not the past he should be talking about, but what is happening right now in front of his nose. If this new president\\'s attachment to human rights is genuine and not just a cynical collection of sound bites, he should not be talking about history, he should be making it. Biden should start to deal with the biggest serial abuser of human rights: Israel.\\n\\nThat there is injustice and discrimination that meets the internationally agreed definition of apartheid, there can no longer be any doubt. One human rights organisation after another has produced exhaustive and scholarly reports testifying to its existence. Last month, it was B’Tselem. This month it was Human Rights Watch. Does Biden challenge this evidence? Does he agree with Israel that these reports are fictional?\\n\\nThe weight of evidence can no longer be ignored, the human rights abuses occur daily.\\n\\nDay by day, the state of Israel, not merely its settlers, or the far right, has become more extreme in enforcing its sovereignty over the people whose lands it has seized. For how long then can Biden defend a regime whose existence depends on the daily use of force over a people that make up 20 percent of its citizens and the majority of the population between the river and the sea?\\n\\nThe Abraham Accords Israel signed with two Arab states were a delusion. Netanyahu calculated that opening relations with Arab states was the means by which he could bypass a Palestinian state and ignore Palestinian rights. He was gravely wrong on both counts.\\n\\nFor Palestinians, it no longer matters how Biden or the rest of the world reacts. Abandoned by the international community, neglected by the media, betrayed by most Arab states, ignored by a leadership that has become irrelevant to their needs, their fate now rests in their hands alone. It rests in the streets. It always has been this way.\\n\\nBut don’t pretend you were not warned when conflict in Jerusalem explodes.\\n\\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.',\n",
              " 'The news that Labour leader Keir Starmer cancelled his attendance to an Open Iftar event due to the organiser’s support for the Boycott, Divestments and Sanctions (BDS) movement, was yet another demonstration to many of us - if further proof was needed – that Muslims and their political views matter very little to the party – and that Palestinians matter even less.\\n\\nAny hint – past or present – of support towards the Palestinian struggle for liberation will be used to delegitimise people, projects, and organisations\\n\\nThe invitation was extended to Starmer by the Ramadan Tent Project (RTP), which provides free iftar meals to all those who attend, every single night of the holy month. Starmer first accepted then later rejected the invite, following backlash from pro-Israel groups.\\n\\nThe Board of Deputies and the Jewish Chronicle flagged up a retweet from Omar Salha, the RTP founder, which called for the boycotting of Israeli dates during Ramadan. Concerns were also raised over his previous support on social media for the advocacy group, Cage, which campaigns for justice for the victims of the \"war on terror\".\\n\\nThis attack on the Open Iftar is being framed as a continuation of the so-called fight against antisemitism. This fight, however, is much more interested in stifling solidarity with the Palestinian people than taking on the alarming rise in racism and fascism in the country.\\n\\nThis tendency has particularly accelerated following the Labour party\\'s adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism, implemented by the party in 2018, which aims to depict criticism of Israel and solidarity with the Palestinian people as a form of antisemitic hate.\\n\\nWhy we are here\\n\\nYears of onslaught from pro-Israel groups – as well as from their allies across every mainstream political party and institutions which stand to benefit politically and economically from the occupation of Palestine – targeted at public figures and political movements who support Palestine have gotten us to this point.\\n\\nUK Labour leader cancels Ramadan event over BDS Read More »\\n\\nAny hint – past or present – of support towards the Palestinian struggle for liberation will be used to delegitimise people, projects, and organisations. Boycotting dates, grown on stolen land, used to enrich the state which dispossesses and colonises Palestinians, is not an extreme form of hatred directed at Jewish people. It is a basic form of solidarity with the oppressed.\\n\\nIt is difficult to believe that such a weak link as a retweet is now enough to brand someone as beyond the pale. That said, if anyone needed more convincing over just how many concessions are being made by Starmer’s Labour to the pro-Israel lobby groups this decision is a powerful illustration.\\n\\nFollowing the iftar cancellation, the deputy at the Board of Deputies, Tal Ofer, tweeted: “Glad to see that after I raised up this issue, Keir Starmer withdrew his participation at the event. That\\'s the correct decision!” The influence of Ofer’s objection was also corroborated from Labour sources.\\n\\nAlso last week, MEE reported that Starmer failed to respond to a letter sent to him last month by more than 25 British-Palestinian Labour members in which they raised concerns about internal treatment. The letter accuses the party of creating a \"hostile environment\" for Palestinians under Starmer.\\n\\n\\n\\nSilencing Palestine activism\\n\\n\"Date-gate\" is only one of the many confirmations that the assaults on Corbyn, Labour Party members, and the left, under the banner of fighting antisemitism were always about silencing Palestine activism rather than fighting antisemitism.\\n\\nThis was also illustrated in the recent disclosure by the Labour Party about their continued use of the same code of conduct that was used under Corbyn’s leadership. The former leader received relentless attacks over the 16-point policy that was being used for antisemitism investigations internally within the party.\\n\\nThe Board of Deputies, amongst others, pointed to this as evidence of \"institutional antisemitism\" within Labour. Yet, the discovery that this was still in use under Starmer’s leadership has not raised the levels of outrage afforded to his predecessor. In fact, the silence from the same accusers that vilified Corbyn on the issue is deafening.\\n\\nLabour Party supporters protest against the expulsion of party members accused of antisemitism outside the party\\'s HQ in London (Reuters)\\n\\nThe goal of this vilification campaign is to make it extremely hard to discuss the oppression faced by the Palestinian people, who continue to live under an apartheid regime. In many ways, by equating anti-Zionism and solidarity with the Palestinian people with antisemitism, the IHRA definition, as well as the more general onslaught against Palestine solidarity movements of which it is a part, are creating an official policy of silencing not only the historical record but also the current violence meted out against Palestinians by the Israeli state.\\n\\nFor example, over the last few weeks, the district of Sheikh Jarrah in East Jerusalem has been under growing assault by Israeli settlers, supported by the state, who aim to ethnically cleanse the neighbourhood. Hundreds of Palestinians face evictions from their homes in order to be replaced with Israeli settlers.\\n\\nThe goal of this vilification campaign has been to make it extremely hard to discuss the oppression faced by the Palestinian people\\n\\nAt the same time, hundreds of Israelis also marched chanting “death to the Arabs” and \"Arabs get out\" outside the Old City of Jerusalem. Palestinians who attempted to defend themselves were met with police violence, and over 100 were left injured.\\n\\nNo consequences are forthcoming from the international community or the British state. In fact, the Johnson government has criticised the ICC for investigating the Palestinian Authority’s charges against Israel for war crimes. In such a time, one might expect the opposition Labour party to raise the alarm and call upon the government to – at the very least – support the implementation of international law. Especially when the leader of said opposition is a human rights lawyer. Instead, Starmer is vilifying those who stand up for Palestinian rights.\\n\\nThis is also exactly why we must refuse to be silenced by the attacks waged against Palestine solidarity while also re-centring – loudly – the Palestinian struggle for liberation.\\n\\nFor too long, what has been encouraged from groups and individuals who find themselves in the eye of public denunciation storms for their pro-Palestine activities or views, is to apologise and defend their anti-racist record. While it is understandable that organisations like RTP engage on such a basis, it will not shelter them from future attacks. Worse still, it serves to undermine the general resistance to these practices.\\n\\nTurning the tide\\n\\nIt has not been easy for Muslims who are faced with the rise of Islamophobia and the curtailing of civil liberties under the cover of the war on terror – the former serving as the justification for the latter – to maintain their place in the public eye. This is particularly the case for the most progressive within the community. It has led to a growing silence, especially from official community organisations, and the avoidance of any political expression whatsoever.\\n\\nLabour antisemitism: Why it has become impossible to criticise Israel Read More »\\n\\nBut if the last few years of seeing Corbyn, pro-Palestine activists, and anti-Islamophobia organisations being dragged through the dirt for their opposition to injustice and oppression demonstrates anything, it is that our silence will not protect us. Only collective, strong, principled and uncompromising defence of our principles can start turning the tide.\\n\\nThis struggle concerns us all. It is a struggle to defend our basic political freedoms, including our right to resist illegal occupations and colonial land grabs through such methods as boycotts. The truth is that anybody that has any regard for the suffering of the Palestinian people should, at the very least, be boycotting Israeli dates, which are grown in the occupied West Bank.\\n\\nIn 2020 Israel was the largest exporter of dates, raking in profits of over $230m on the basis of this illegal trade. Muslims should absolutely avoid being complicit with Israeli crimes during the holy month – as should everyone, the whole year round.

              " 'The hashtags #SaveSheikhJarrah and its Arabic equivalent began appearing on my Twitter timeline recently. As a Palestinian activist, my first move was to find out more - to determine what new challenge faced the residents of this Palestinian neighbourhood.\\n\\nSheikh Jarrah, a district of Jerusalem, always sparks flashbacks to my boyhood. While both my parents are from Jerusalem, I was born in Saudi Arabia before the 1967 war and the fall of what remained of Palestine, including East Jerusalem, into Israel’s hands.\\n\\nThe screams of anguish and worry of these families, including the family of my late cousin Jamal, should not fall on deaf ears\\n\\nI distinctly remember my mother talking about the occupation of her city of birth with deep sadness and concern for her family, which was also my father’s family, as they were cousins. I remember seeing her and other Palestinian women working together to fundraise for Palestine, which included making many Palestinian flags.\\n\\nWe were able to visit occupied Palestine a couple of years after that, when my grandmother applied for a permit for my mother and father to visit. Half the family lived in Jericho, and the rest in Jerusalem’s Wadi al-Joz neighbourhood. After a few days in Jericho, we headed to Jerusalem for our summer holidays.\\n\\nI distinctly remember making friends with my cousin Jamal in Jerusalem. He was a fiery boy, adventurous and fun-loving. He would take me from our grandmother’s home in Wadi al-Joz to his home in Sheikh Jarrah. It was a quick climb down a hill onto a main road in an industrial area, where buses and coaches parked and departed.\\n\\nThen, it was across some empty land, and I remember him pointing out some caves as we walked. We soon arrived at his home, which he shared with his sister, Ghada; his mother, my aunt Fawziah; and her husband, Harbi Atieh, who had a small shop in their garden. We ate some of my auntie’s delicious food and played before Jamal took me back to my grandmother’s house.\\n\\nThe next time I visited their house was in 2015. It was now Jamal’s home, shared with his wife and children - his parents having passed away decades earlier. We had a traditional Palestinian hummus and falafel breakfast in the garden. Five years later, Jamal passed away after a long battle with cancer.\\n\\nThose happy and sad memories came flooding back when I read the hashtags calling for Sheikh Jarrah to be saved. The call is for the remaining Palestinian families, comprising some 550 people, to be saved from eviction by the occupying force, Israel.\\n\\nTargeted by settlers\\n\\nThe story goes back to 1956, when Jordan struck an agreement with the United Nations to build housing units for 28 families in Sheikh Jarrah, in exchange for them renouncing their refugee status with the UN. Under the deal, titles to the properties would be transferred to the families three years later. The Atieh family was among these families, but that final transfer did not happen, making the area a target for Israel and its settlers.\\n\\nIn the early 1970s, Israeli settler organisations, determined to expand the Jewish presence in East Jerusalem, began targeting Sheikh Jarrah with a view to evicting Palestinian families and replacing them with Jewish settlers. An Israeli court ultimately allowed settler groups to “reclaim” their property in the neighbourhood, despite a lack of official ownership papers.\\n\\nJewish settlers clash with Peace Now activists in Sheikh Jarrah, Jerusalem, in 2017 (AFP)\\n\\nThe takeover of Sheikh Jarrah by Jewish settlers has not been wholesale, but creeping. In 2002, 43 Palestinians were evicted from Sheikh Jarrah after losing a legal battle to settlers. And who can forget the image of the al-Kurd family being evicted in 2008? The elderly couple was literally thrown out of their home of five decades, while Jewish settlers took over. A year later, the Hanoun and Ghawi families were forcibly evicted in favour of settlers.\\n\\nThe ethnic cleansing of Sheikh Jarrah continues unabated. The Israeli District Court recently ordered four more families to leave their homes or face eviction by 2 May, prompting the Sheikh Jarrah community to organise a campaign to resist this immoral and illegal act, with a Facebook page and resources explaining the background to the painful story and the families’ demands.\\n\\nTheir demands are essentially that their rights to ownership of their homes are recognised by the occupying force, Israel, and that the families who have already been evicted be allowed to return to their homes.\\n\\nImmoral policies\\n\\nAre these demands, after 65 years of de facto ownership of their homes, really that difficult for Israel to recognise - or does this situation merely confirm Israel as a settler-colonial, racist state? East Jerusalem is illegally occupied under international law. Israel is therefore committing a war crime by evicting Palestinians from their homes and moving its own settler population into them.\\n\\nIt is also acting hypocritically, barring Palestinian refugees from West Jerusalem from reclaiming the homes from which they were expelled in the 1948 Nakba.\\n\\nSave Sheikh Jarrah: The online campaign giving hope to Palestinian refugees in East Jerusalem Read More »\\n\\nSheikh Jarrah does not stand alone as an area that Israel wants to Judaise. Another area that has suffered terribly from Israel’s aggressive and immoral policies is Silwan, on the other side of al-Aqsa Mosque. Plans have been unveiled to force out 100 Palestinian families in the Batan al-Hawa area, to be replaced by Jewish inhabitants.\\n\\nIt seems that Israel was emboldened by the Trump administration’s support, and the recent “normalisation” agreements with some Arab countries, to strangle East Jerusalem, extinguishing its Palestinian presence in favour of Jewish settlers. This will change its historic character, and its look and feel, forever.\\n\\nBritain has a historic responsibility to act, as it was the birthplace of the dreadful Balfour Declaration in 1917. Its consulate sits on a hill in Sheikh Jarrah, a stone’s throw from the site of the Palestinian evictions. It is not helpless to act, though its silence might indicate otherwise. It could at least show solidarity with Palestinians, but it does not. That was left to more than 80 British parliamentarians in a letter to Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab.\\n\\nPariah state\\n\\nThe screams of anguish and worry from these families, including the family of my late cousin Jamal, should not fall on deaf ears. The world should be united in condemning another deliberate act by a country that claims to be a democracy, but has been revealed as an apartheid state, even in a report by an Israeli human rights group.\\n\\nRaab and all foreign secretaries of so-called western democracies should be summoning their Israeli ambassadors and demanding an end to the eviction of Palestinians from their homes - without which they should begin treating Israel as the pariah state that it is.

Two months later, I received an email from customs clearance - the beginning of a long journey of security checks and other procedures.\\n\\nOver the next two months, I had to provide numerous documents and fill out various forms attesting to the nature of the package. But even after having sent my ID, proof of payment for the trophy, the supplier invoice and proof that the trophy was for personal use, among other documents, I received a call from the customs clearance coordinator, who told me that even after the parcel was released from Israeli customs, getting it into Gaza would be another story.\\n\\nSuffocating blockade\\n\\nI continued following the required procedures, while also looking for couriers permitted to deliver parcels from the occupied West Bank to Gaza. In the first week of April, I was sent a form in Hebrew and English by the Israeli tax authority to provide my personal details.\\n\\nWhat struck me the most while filling in this form was that as a Palestinian from Gaza, where the Israeli occupation dismantled its settlements and withdrew its forces in 2005, I had never had to deal directly with Israeli bodies or fill out application forms in Hebrew.\\n\\nAn Israeli tank on the Erez crossing in 2012 (AFP)\\n\\nFor the first time since the Gaza blockade was imposed, I realised there was something worse than the strangling hurdles and restrictions imposed on us for the past 15 years. It was the reality of the occupation, where a Palestinian in her own country has to fill out application forms in the language of her occupier to get approval for basic human rights. As a journalist who reports on human rights violations committed by Israeli occupation forces, I found this humiliating and painful.\\n\\nFor the past 15 years, Israel has imposed severe restrictions on the movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza, as part of the blockade launched in 2006 and tightened in 2007 after Hamas won legislative elections in the enclave.\\n\\nSuch restrictions, however, have been part of Palestinians’ daily lives since the 1948 Nakba. Prior to the establishment of Israel and the occupation of Palestine, for decades, Palestinians were commercially connected to Europe and the Middle East via the Mediterranean Sea. After 1948, Israel forcefully controlled all exit and entry points, preventing people from travelling or exchanging goods without its permission.\\n\\nProhibited packages\\n\\nAmid this backdrop, to get my trophy into Gaza from Ramallah in the occupied West Bank - around 100 kilometres, or a two-hour drive away - I needed to coordinate with a licensed courier permitted by Israeli authorities to deliver parcels to Gaza. I contacted DHL and FedEx, the only two well-known international couriers that operate in both the occupied West Bank and Gaza, to start coordinating the delivery of the trophy once it was released from Israeli customs.\\n\\nBoth told me that only paper documents could be sent from the West Bank to Gaza, and vice versa. Parcels containing other materials were not permitted. “This ban comes from the Israeli side, and we are not responsible for it,” a FedEx representative in the occupied West Bank told me over the phone. “Israel prohibits any mail other than paper mail into Gaza.”\\n\\nMEE journalist Maha Hussaini wins Martin Adler Prize Read More »\\n\\nFor years, Israel has imposed severe restrictions on shipments to Gaza, under the pretext that Hamas could be smuggling weapons, such as knives, drones and communications equipment. It regulates the entrance of all materials into Gaza, including items it classifies as “dual-use”, requiring special permission to enter; these include items “whose use is overwhelmingly civilian and critical for civilian life”, notes Gisha, an Israeli human rights group.\\n\\nFor ordinary parcel post, intensive security checks can delay delivery for many months. Despite the exhausting procedures connected to receiving my trophy, and even as I gradually lost hope, I continued pushing for its release from Israeli customs.\\n\\nAfter completing all the requirements, I finally received a phone call this month from customs clearance, informing me that the trophy would be finally released - once I paid 803 Israeli shekels (around $250). I was presented with an invoice that included categories such as system fees, security check fees, computer fees and other fees covering the costs of storing the parcel for five months.\\n\\nWhen I asked for clarification, a customs clearance employee told me in an email that “all FedEx parcels that pass through Israeli customs and security checks are charged high costs, especially if the address is not Israeli”. This means that regardless of the nature of the parcel, as long as it is sent to a Palestinian address, it is automatically security-checked and charged high costs.\\n\\nSurveillance and control\\n\\nAs these security checks constitute a significant part of Israel’s surveillance and control mechanism imposed upon Palestinians, Israel has gradually been privatising the process. The Erez land crossing into Gaza was among the first checkpoint to be privatised in January 2006; today, at least 14 Israeli checkpoints, including two border crossings between Gaza and Israel, have been privatised.\\n\\nWhile the costs of privatised checkpoints are estimated at upwards of $80m annually, Palestinians bear a high proportion of these costs tied to their personal and commercial surveillance and control. Under the Israeli occupation, victims pay for the tools of oppression that are systematically used against them.\\n\\nToday, I am writing this article on the desk where I recorded my prize acceptance speech, after having informed the customs clearance body that I refuse to pay to receive the trophy. A journalist awarded a prize for reporting on the occupation’s abuses cannot pay the costs of that same occupation violating her basic rights.\\n\\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.\",\n",
              " \"Politicians close to decision-making circles in Amman say the state narrative in Prince Hamzah’s case - which has dominated public attention in the kingdom for weeks - has been overshadowed by the opposition narrative.\\n\\nAdversarial media personalities, particularly from abroad, have flooded Jordanian cyberspace, and hashtags in support of the prince continue to dominate. Hundreds of thousands of fake social media accounts from neighbouring Arab countries are working to disrupt the official narrative and internal state stability, Prime Minister Bisher al-Khasawneh told reporters. Journalists close to the government have reported such claims uncritically.\\n\\nBut the state narrative has not convinced many average Jordanians, despite a segment of society that leans towards the “conspiracy” perspective upon which the government has depended. Indeed, many continue to sympathise with Prince Hamzah.\\n\\nSuch wisdom is today often absent from government decisions, which explains the confusion in dealing with crises - some of which begin small, but grow out of control\\n\\nAnalysts cite two main reasons for the apparent failure of the state narrative. The first is inconsistencies and lack of cohesion in the story itself, from early claims of a failed coup attempt involving regional parties that was foiled at “zero hour”, to accusations that Prince Hamzah was involved in the scheme, to conflicting suggestions that the prince’s role was limited to siding with the popular opposition movement. The king ultimately asserted that the threat had been contained.\\n\\nThe state account fluctuated between two extremes: that Prince Hamzah’s contentious online behaviour and frequent visits to various governorates marked an unprecedented threat to the royal family’s heritage and political stability, amid public demands that Prince Hamzah be reinstated as crown prince. At the other extreme were state claims that Prince Hamzah was involved in a conspiracy, coordinated alongside external hostile powers, and was eyeing the throne.\\n\\nThe second reason for the public’s lack of faith in the state narrative, analysts say, is the growing gap in trust and credibility from which successive Jordanian governments have suffered for years. This has prompted many to question the state’s version of events.\\n\\nFragile state institutions\\n\\nYet there is a third reason that may be more important than the previous two: the political vacuum in Jordan, evident through the weakness and fragility exhibited by the government and state institutions. Even those who have a political presence in the streets and the ability to advise the king - including those whose views differ from his preconceived notions, as long as it is in the interests of stability - are absent.\\n\\nJordan: Why King Abdullah's troubles are not over Read More »\\n\\nThe late King Hussein was surrounded by world-class statesmen from various political backgrounds, who served as advisers and participated in lengthy policy discussions. Some opposed the king on certain matters and ultimately convinced him to change course, as can be seen through the diaries of former military chief Zaid ibn Shaker, former politician Mudar Badran and former diplomat Adnan Abu Odeh.\\n\\nSuch wisdom is today often absent from government decisions, which explains the confusion in dealing with crises - some of which begin small, but grow out of control due to the “crisis-management crisis”.\\n\\nThe Prince Hamzah affair would not have reached this stage of polarisation with regards to domestic public opinion if state institutions were confident and able to fill the void, and if there were statesmen with the wisdom and courage to respond properly and to bear the consequences vis-a-vis the Jordanian public.\\n\\nInstead, from the outset, most ministers went into hiding, and it was clear that former officials who wanted to justify the state’s behaviour lacked accurate information, causing great damage to the country’s image internally and externally, while weakening the credibility of the state narrative.\\n\\nConfidence shaken\\n\\nDespite support for Jordan from the world’s governments during this crisis - in particular, from the Biden administration in the US - coverage by western media shook the confidence of local officials and sent them into retreat. A particularly harsh Foreign Policy article titled “Jordan Has Become a Banana Monarchy” was shared widely online, angering political insiders.\\n\\nThe issue, however, extends beyond Prince Hamzah’s case to the general political situation in Jordan overall. Even if the recent crisis has been contained - at least in the short term - and most of those accused have been released, calls for political reform in the aftermath of the crisis point to a collective realisation that there is a political vacuum in Jordan that needs to be filled, and that the country’s political life must be rehabilitated.\\n\\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.\",\n",
              " 'There are few doubts that the 21st century will be characterised by the struggle against climate change. The new Joe Biden administration in the US has given it top priority, with ambitious targets, such as carbon-pollution-free electricity generation by 2035 and net-zero emissions by 2050.\\n\\nOn his first day in office, President Biden had the US rejoin the Paris climate agreement. Former Secretary of State John Kerry has been appointed climate czar. At the same time, a $1.9tn stimulus package will boost the country’s recovery in the wake of Covid-19, and Biden is making massive investments in infrastructure and manufacturing, to be largely funded by corporate tax hikes.\\n\\nConsidering how the US has been economically managed over the last four decades, especially regarding corporate taxation, these decisions seem like a revolution. A core driving force is to move the country, and the rest of the world, towards a green economy.\\n\\nEpochal transformation\\n\\nAlthough in a more convoluted way and with far less resources, the EU is on the same path with its own recovery plan, known as Next Generation EU. After the global financial crisis, austerity measures and Covid-19, there are now marching orders for an epochal transformation - a Great Reset, as described by the Davos World Economic Forum. It is built around a global Green New Deal and a digital economy delivered by the Fourth Industrial Revolution, aiming to ambitiously “build back better”.\\n\\nAt the same time, top asset management companies are signing the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, which commits them to environmental sustainability. More than 70 companies, including giants such as BlackRock and Vanguard, are notifying the businesses encompassed in their huge investment portfolios that climate change has become central to their investment strategies. Every business will have a binary choice: contribute towards zeroing emissions, or perish.\\n\\nThe perverse geopolitical clash over fossil fuels could replicate itself over renewable energies\\n\\nYet, while this is a heartening perspective for current and future generations, it is also worth reflecting on some potential implications.\\n\\nOn 27 January, Biden signed an executive order on tackling climate change, affirming that “climate considerations shall be an essential element of United States foreign policy and national security”. Taken literally, this could suggest that any country that is not deemed sufficiently effective in reducing net emissions could be called a threat to the US, with all the potential consequences that entails.\\n\\nThe so-called rules-based international order (enforced by the US) could then see another benchmark added to the checklist of states’ compliance, together with the hegemony of the dollar as the reserve currency, the so-called Washington Consensus on economic management, the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and all the other terms of reference for US global leadership.\\n\\nUnfortunately, in the last three decades, these terms and tools have been progressively and selectively politicised, and often weaponised, sometimes with harmful double standards. Today, the US-led world order is openly contested and challenged.\\n\\nTriggering tensions\\n\\nShould such an extreme scenario play out, it would be reasonable to expect additional tensions in an already volatile international sphere. Although China is moving towards renewable energies, its transition might require more time; the same is even truer for Russia. Both are already high in Washington’s autocracies index. In addition, smaller and weaker countries may still be too dependent on fossil fuels to move speedily towards sustainable alternatives.\\n\\nWe could end up in a paradoxical situation where a necessary struggle to save the planet could trigger new tensions that ultimately complicate this important objective.\\n\\nThe risk would be the creation of first-, second- and third-class countries - green, grey and black respectively - with all the attendant tensions. This could significantly affect the Middle East, but also other fossil-fuel producers, such as Venezuela, Nigeria, Brazil and Mexico. Gulf countries have already made investments to prepare for such a transition, while others - Libya, Syria, Iraq, Iran and Egypt - are still struggling with conflicts, sanctions and poor governance.\\n\\nThe sun sets over an oil refinery in southern Iraq on 8 March 2021 (AFP)\\n\\nThe transition to renewable energies should be managed promptly and properly; otherwise, political, economic and social turmoil, with massive unemployment and potential new migration flows, could follow. This is not just a matter of will, but also of good governance when it comes to industrial and energy policies.\\n\\nThe massive availability of uninhabited lands in the MENA region offers huge potential for profitable and cost-effective wind and solar plants. New strategic partnerships could be formed across the shores of the Mediterranean, based on energy security promoted by renewable sources. What has not been achieved politically through the failed Euro-Mediterranean Barcelona Process a quarter-century ago, may now be accomplished through pragmatic and mutually satisfactory cooperation on renewable energies.\\n\\nUnique opportunity\\n\\nThe US, EU, China, major UN agencies and the global donor community could preempt the systemic risks outlined above with massive investments, technical assistance and knowledge transfer to assist the more fragile MENA economies towards such a transition, without major economic disruptions. Some major European energy companies have already committed to such a path, including Italy’s Snam, which is active in hydrogen production from renewable sources located in North Africa that appear promising.\\n\\nClimate crisis: 13 ways the Middle East is under threat Read More »\\n\\nThe major obstacles are the enduring conflicts, along with the political and economic tensions, in the region. These include, among others, the crises in Libya and Syria, the excessive autocracy in Egypt, the apparently never-ending political hibernation in Algeria, and the oil-and-gas wars in the Eastern Mediterranean. In the absence of a resolution, the latter could also affect future power grids charged with delivering renewable power. The perverse geopolitical clash over fossil fuels could replicate itself over renewable energies.\\n\\nTo remove such obstacles, major global stakeholders should cooperate and reject the usual temptation of zero-sum games.\\n\\nThe EU has a real chance to project sustainable growth along its turbulent southern and southeastern borders. It could tackle migration, stimulate job creation and improve its energy security through diversifying supplies, while also creating the proper framework to defeat radicalism. Yet, this will not be possible without concomitant efforts by MENA countries to improve their governance, starting by tackling endemic corruption and cronyism.\\n\\nFor the first time in decades, all the elements are in place for a win-win situation for all countries on both shores of the Mediterranean and beyond. Political vision combined with good intelligence will be crucial to accomplish it. To waste such a unique opportunity would be unforgivable.\\n\\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.',\n",
              " 'Following Hamas\\'s stunning victory in 2006 elections in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, one would have thought no more elections would ever be called for by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.\\n\\nMany Hamas officials never trusted Abbas - some were confident he would never dare go ahead with an election he knew he was going to lose\\n\\nIn fact, had it not been for the insistence of former US President George W Bush as part of his drive for \"democratisation\" in the region, Abbas would not have held the elections at the time. But instead of celebrating democracy, the elections resulted in a tribal war between Fatah, which controls the Palestinian Authority (PA), and Hamas, which professes resistance against the Israeli occupation.\\n\\nThe former could not concede defeat while the latter could not gain world recognition as the legitimately elected government of the Palestinian people. This \"war\" resulted in division and bitter hostility with Gaza under Hamas control but besieged by both Egypt and Israel, while the West Bank fell under joint Israeli and PA control thanks to Fatah\\'s collaboration.\\n\\nYet, a few weeks back, and 15 years later, Abbas seemed determined to go ahead with holding fresh elections at three levels and in three stages: the Palestinian Legislative Council, followed by Palestinian presidential elections and then, perhaps, elections for the PLO Palestine National Council. The decision, the fruit of many rounds of reconciliation talks with Hamas, was expected to usher in a new era of Palestinian politics, one in which Palestinians unite in the face of Israeli expansionism, international collusion and Arab indifference.\\n\\nMany reasons were suggested for going down that route. Yet, one word sums up the motivation on both sides of the divide, and that is \"predicament\".\\n\\nThe predicament\\n\\nAbbas’ predicament emanated from the steady erosion of his personal legitimacy as well as the legitimacy of the despotic and corrupt authority he presides over in Ramallah. He is believed to have decided to hold the elections because of pressure from European and other donors.\\n\\nPalestine elections: A leap into the unknown for Fatah and Hamas Read More »\\n\\nHamas’ predicament, on the other hand, emanated from the siege imposed on it in the Gaza Strip, the war waged against it constantly by both Israel and PA security agencies in the West Bank, and the continued haemorrhage of regional logistical, financial and political support amid the rising tide of Arab normalisation with Israel.\\n\\nAbbas did not foresee the impact the election process was to have on his own organisation, Fatah. He probably thought that he could easily handle the rivalry posed to him by one dissenting faction, the one led by Mohammad Dahlan, who has been based in exile in the UAE since being expelled from the Fatah movement by Abbas in 2011.\\n\\nHowever, for an iconic figure like Marwan Barghouthi, who languishes in Israeli captivity for his role in the Second Intifada in 2000, to challenge Abbas from within his own movement is a much higher risk to take. Barghouthi’s list quickly gained the support of a number of influential figures within Fatah, the faction that constitutes the backbone of the PA, which appeared to be on the verge of disintegrating.\\n\\nA Palestinian watches Mahmud Abbas speech on the Palestinian elections in the occupied West Bank on 29 April, 2021 (AFP)\\n\\nConsequently, and despite its own difficulties, Hamas was likely to emerge victorious out of the elections. With Hamas\\' prospects enhanced by a Fatah in turmoil, neither Israel nor the US, let alone the PA, would be eager for the elections to proceed.\\n\\nA futile exercise\\n\\nBut Abbas needed a good excuse to break his promise and go back on his agreement with Hamas. No one could serve him with a better excuse than the Israelis themselves, and there was nothing better than the highly emotive issue of Jerusalem.\\n\\nHow can one expect democracy to work under occupation, when the entire Palestinian population is either in shackles or under siege?\\n\\nFor some weeks, Palestinians were expecting the elections to be cancelled simply because the Israelis were adamant that the Palestinians of Jerusalem would not be allowed to take part in the voting process, while Abbas was insistent that he would not proceed without them.\\n\\nOf course, Jerusalem is important for the Palestinians, and not just because of its symbolism, but should the barring of its inhabitant from voting in a Palestinian election be a convincing justification for calling off the entire process? Abbas and his entourage believe so although many other Palestinians do not agree with them.\\n\\nSceptics, like myself, feel vindicated. First of all, how can one expect democracy to work under occupation, when the entire Palestinian population is either in shackles or under siege. How can people make a free choice when they are not free at all? One of the principal stipulations of a genuine democratic process is freedom: freedom of speech, of assembly, of movement and of choice.\\n\\nSecond, as far as Israel and the international community are concerned, only an election won by Fatah would be acceptable. But what if elections were held and Hamas won, as it did in 2006? Would the international community - again - insist that Hamas would not be recognised or dealt with until and unless it accepted the three Quartet conditions?\\n\\nIf so, what’s the point of this futile exercise? Arabs have a saying that goes as follows: \"Only a fool insists on trying what has already been tried!\"\\n\\nThe real issue\\n\\nSome Hamas leaders, as I know personally, are no less sceptical. Yet, the movement reckoned that any dynamic would be better than stagnation. Furthermore, they did not want to provide Abbas with any pretext to cancel or postpone the process, which was supposed to lead to the long-awaited national reconciliation, and blame that on Hamas.\\n\\nJerusalem is ready to explode - the world can\\'t say it wasn\\'t warned Read More »\\n\\nDespite all their public statements, many Hamas officials never trusted Abbas. Some were even confident he would never dare go ahead with an election he knew he was going to lose. They have dealt with him enough to know him well.\\n\\nPutting aside the predicaments of both Abbas and Hamas, the Israeli occupation and not the election is the real issue for the Palestinian people as a whole.\\n\\nLooked at from the perspective of those who negotiated peace with Israel and signed the Oslo accords in 1993, the creation of the PA was supposed to have been the first step along the march towards statehood. However, since its inception, the PA has, in reality, only served the occupation.\\n\\nAs Israel continued at an ever-increasing pace its usurpation of Palestinian land and expansion of illegal settlements, the PA never ceased to act as the security apparatus mandated with the task of controlling the Palestinians and curtailing their response to Israeli violations of their basic rights.\\n\\nMore and more Palestinians have come to realise that Oslo was nothing short of another Nakba (catastrophe). Therefore, undoing Oslo, dismantling the PA and reviving resistance in all possible forms and with all available means is what the Palestinians need to unite over and not some electoral process that is no more than an illusion.\\n\\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.',\n",
              " \"Every British government has its diarist; a secret scribbler, usually one who dwells in the foothills of power, quietly observing the comings and goings of the big beasts and the events that preoccupy them.\\n\\nIt was Alan Clark, a middle-ranking defence minister, whose bestselling diaries sensationally illuminated the Thatcher decade. In the mid-1990s, Gyles Brandreth, a lowly whip, provided the best inside account of John Major’s disintegrating government. Then, as now, the Tories were tearing themselves apart over Europe.\\n\\nDuncan, despite being a model of discretion in public, was privately scathing about the UK's attitude towards Israel\\n\\nMy own three volumes of diaries (two of which scraped into the bestseller lists) charted the rise and fall of New Labour under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. More recently, Sasha Swire, the wife of Hugo Swire, who served as a minister in David Cameron’s government, provided glimpses of life inside the tiny elite who governed us between 2010 and 2016.\\n\\nNow Alan Duncan, a middle-ranking Foreign Office minister, delivers a behind-the-scenes account of these last five turbulent years of political life in Britain, titled In the Thick of It. The stakes are high. Brexit, the rise of Boris Johnson and Britain’s diminishing role in the world are the big themes.\\n\\nIn passing, he also sheds light on a little-known area: Britain’s close relationship with the strategically vital Gulf state of Oman. It is no secret that Britain has long been heavily involved in Oman, one of the UK’s last remaining outposts in the Middle East. British officers staff the Omani armed forces, and the communications monitoring agency, GCHQ has a base there. In addition, the sultanate, like many of its neighbours, is an important market for British weapons.\\n\\nOmani sultan's 'privy council'\\n\\nDuncan’s interest in the region dates back to his days as an oil trader. In 2014, Cameron appointed him a special envoy to Oman, a job he took very seriously. He was a member of what he refers to as the sultan’s “privy council”, a group of six prominent members of the British establishment who meet annually with the sultan to offer advice.\\n\\nDuncan says he has attended 14 such meetings since 2001, and one has only to run an eye down the cast list to gauge the importance the UK attaches to the relationship. Fellow members of the so-called privy council have included serving and former heads of the Secret Intelligence Service, a former private secretary to the Queen, several former chiefs of the armed forces, and Mervyn King, the former governor of the Bank of England.\\n\\nThe entertainment is lavish. Duncan writes of the sultan’s New Year’s dinner in 2019: “I was in the same seat I’ve occupied for the last 20 years … it was not so much a buffet as a sumptuous feast with two lines of tables, each perhaps 15 yards long groaning with massive platters of lobster, prawns, chicken etc. That’s just for starters. We come back again beneath domed silver lids. Then puddings and the New Year cake which is eight feet high … Dinner finished about 2am and then we had a concert until 4.30am.”\\n\\nOman’s Sultan Qaboos, who reigned for almost 50 years, died in January 2020 and was succeeded by his cousin. A high-level delegation had to be scrambled at short notice to pay respects to the new ruler: Prince Charles, the prime minister, the defence secretary and the chief of defence staff. Be in no doubt: Oman matters to the UK.\\n\\nGiven his longstanding interest in the region, the author might reasonably have expected that his Foreign Office responsibilities would include the Middle East. But the Conservative Friends of Israel, noting his pro-Palestinian sympathies, had other ideas.\\n\\nDuncan’s entry for 16 July 2016 notes: “At 5.30pm I go to the Foreign Office. All seems clear and agreed that I will be minister for the Middle East, as expected … But when I see Boris [Johnson] at 6pm it seems a massive problem has arisen … Boris says the Conservative Friends of Israel are going ballistic … As I see it, it is for no other reason than that I believe in the rights of Palestinians and whereas they pretend to believe in two parallel states, it is quite clear that they don’t and so they set out to destroy genuine advocates for Palestine.”\\n\\nCowards in the face of Israel\\n\\nIt seems that pro-Israel groups were also lobbying the prime minister’s office: “Now Number 10 are telling Boris I cannot have the Middle East … In any other country [this] … would in my view be seen as entrenched espionage.” In fairness, there were other objections, with Duncan’s former business connections in the Middle East were also seen as a problem. He was ultimately allocated responsibility for Europe and the Americas, with the exception of Oman, which he was allowed to keep.\\n\\nThere was a curious sequel to this little episode. Shai Masot, an Israeli diplomat, was caught on camera talking of “taking down” Duncan. The Israeli ambassador called to apologise, asserting that the individual concerned had been hired locally and did not have diplomatic status. “All total bollocks,” writes Duncan. “Masot is a first or second secretary, a member of military intelligence, employed specifically as a parliamentary and undercover propagandist.”\\n\\nThe raw truth about the UK's special relationship with Israel Read More »\\n\\nThe incident was quickly brushed under the carpet. Masot, who also had Labour Party contacts, was sent home. The British government, anxious to avoid a row with the Israelis, did not pursue the matter. Neither did the Labour Party, which has been cowed by allegations of antisemitism.\\n\\nDuncan, despite being a model of discretion in public, was privately scathing about the UK’s attitude towards Israel. “We are supine, lickspittle, insignificant cowards,” he remarks after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was feted at Downing Street.\\n\\n“Where is the British reaction?” he asks after a pro-settlement Israeli politician asserted that all of the occupied West Bank belonged to Israel.\\n\\n“It is not just the end of the two-state solution. It is the end of any principled stand on the issue by the UK, given that this has always been a red-line for us and we intend to do nothing,” he writes of an Israeli plan to evict 500 Bedouin from land on the edge of Jerusalem to make way for settlers.\\n\\nHaunted by Brexit\\n\\nBut it is Brexit, not Israel, that haunts this volume. Indeed, it haunts the entire Conservative Party.\\n\\nIn February 2016, Duncan, a long-time Eurosceptic, briefly flirted with the Leave campaign, but one visit to the Vote Leave headquarters was enough to bring home to him the company he would be keeping and, thereafter, he was solidly behind the Remain campaign.\\n\\nHe explains his conversion thus: “Somewhere along the line from the early 1990s the cause of honest and thoughtful Euro-scepticism mutated into a form of simplistic nationalism which strikes me as ugly and demeaning. Instead of campaigning for the reform of outdated EU institutions and seeking a better deal for the UK, too many Euro-sceptics retreated instead into crude sloganeering. There was a rational and pragmatic case to be made for leaving the EU, but few bothered to make it. Instead we faced a wave of populist nonsense, emotive platitudes and downright lies.”\\n\\n'He is a clown, a self-centred ego, an embarrassing buffoon, with an untidy mind and sub-zero diplomatic judgement' - Duncan on Boris Johnson\\n\\nAlthough sympathetic to the impossible task she faced and publicly loyal throughout to the then-prime minister, Theresa May, Duncan, like others, despaired at her lack of empathy: “No poise or presence. Charisma by-pass. No personality.”\\n\\nIn July 2016, Boris Johnson was appointed foreign secretary and Duncan, his deputy in all but name, was well-placed to observe. His opinion of Johnson was low. Six days before May was due to make a major speech on Europe, Johnson published a lengthy essay setting out what were described as his “red lines” on the subject, thereby entirely undermining her.\\n\\nOnce again, Duncan was scathing: “[He] thinks he is the next Churchill. He has a self-deluding, mock-romantic passion which is not rooted in realism. He is disloyal. A decade of press attention has gone to his head and he doesn’t appreciate that the gloss has gone. His comedy routine has gone stale; his lack of seriousness in a serious job rankles … He is a clown, a self-centred ego, an embarrassing buffoon, with an untidy mind and sub-zero diplomatic judgement. He is an international stain on our reputation … a lonely, selfish, shambolic, ill-disciplined, shameless clot.”\\n\\nMaybe. But it is a measure of Britain’s decline in the world that this man is now our prime minister. Somewhere in the bowels of government, another secret scribbler will be at work continuing to chart the UK’s remorseless slide into insularity and irrelevance. Oh yes, and I have it on good authority that the Queen keeps a diary, too. I wonder what she makes of it all.\\n\\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.\",\n",

It looked at Johnson\\'s alleged financial difficulties, suggesting that he is struggling to pay for extensive domestic commitments on his £150,000 ($192.000) a year prime ministerial salary.\\n\\nThe article paints a cruel picture of Johnson as a man filled with private despair.\\n\\nBut the main significance of this piece is its publication by The Times, the flagship newspaper in the Rupert Murdoch empire, which backed Johnson for the premiership last December.\\n\\nNine months later Murdoch, Johnson\\'s loyal ally, has become his unforgiving enemy.\\n\\nThe vote leave machine\\n\\nThere are signs that the Associated Newspapers, owners of the powerful Daily Mail, are also turning against him. Only the Barclay Brothers, owners of the Telegraph, remain supportive. The skids are under Johnson.\\n\\nTackling Johnson and keeping Cummings will change nothing. And getting rid of Cummings is more easily said than done\\n\\nBut will changing the prime minister make any real difference? I think not.\\n\\nAs I\\'ve written before in these columns, hapless Johnson is manipulated and dictated to by a closely knit group of Vote Leave enforcers, of whom the two most powerful are his cabinet colleague Michael Gove and his \"senior adviser\" Dominic Cummings.\\n\\nThis means that the chaos will not end until Gove, Cummings and their associates have gone. A telling anecdote in that destructive Times article showed the inviolate power wielded by the Gove/Cummings Vote Leave machine.\\n\\nThe anecdote concerns Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis\\' calamitous announcement to parliament that Britain intended to break international law. According to the Times, the Northern Ireland secretary was given \"the words to say\" by a former Vote Leave staffer, Oliver Lewis.\\n\\nIt\\'s not clear whether Johnson even knew what was going on.\\n\\nDominic Cummings, special adviser for Britain\\'s Prime Minister Boris Johnson, walks along Whitehall in London, Britain on 10 September (Reuters)\\n\\n\\n\\nAs Tacitus wrote of the Emperor Galba: \"Omnium consensu capax imperii, nisi imperasset\". Translation: \"Considered capable of ruling until was put in charge.\"\\n\\nSo let\\'s spell out exactly who needs to go if Britain is to get back on her feet: Lee Cain, Johnson\\'s director of communications; Cummings, his senior adviser, who breached lockdown rules but was backed by the prime minister. Also, Cummings\\' proteges such as Oliver Lewis; Suella Braverman, the attorney general, who doesn\\'t understand the need to protect the law; incompetent careerist Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who has made such a mess of handling the Covid-19 pandemic; and lastly, the over-promoted Home Secretary Priti Patel.\\n\\nI could add others to this list.\\n\\nA new prime minister?\\n\\nBritain certainly needs a new prime minister who will restore grown-up government and respect for the rule of law. But tackling Johnson and keeping Cummings will change nothing. And getting rid of Cummings is more easily said than done.\\n\\nIf Johnson goes, any leadership contest would likely be won by the most right-wing candidate\\n\\nBear in mind that if Johnson goes, his successor will be chosen by the approximately 190,000 Conservative Party members. Chillingly, that means this tiny group – well under 1 percent of the electorate - currently controls the destiny of Britain.\\n\\nAccording to a poll by YouGov, many hold bigoted views. For example, more than half of those polled said that Islam was a threat to British life.\\n\\nIf Johnson goes, any leadership contest would likely be won by the most right-wing candidate. That could mean immigrant-bashing Patel, already grossly over-promoted as home secretary.\\n\\nThere\\'s no reason to suppose she would be any more competent than Johnson. Gove - Rupert Murdoch\\'s favourite member of the cabinet - is another troubling possibility. By conventional measurement the two most impressive candidates are Chancellor Rishi Sunak and former health secretary Jeremy Hunt.\\n\\nHunt came second in the Tory leadership contest won comfortably by Johnson last year.\\n\\nBritain\\'s Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak (AFP)\\n\\nHe\\'s made a lot of sensible comments during the Covid-19 emergency and was one of the voices urging the government to take action quicker when the outbreak first gained momentum in March. A voice of sanity compared to the panic and confusion emerging from Downing Street, his presence in Downing Street would calm things down and go some way to restoring Britain\\'s broken international reputation.\\n\\nBut would the Tory membership vote for him? Doubtful.\\n\\nChancellor Rishi Sunak has his fans. He is judged to have managed Treasury finances during the pandemic well, but harder decisions are on the horizon. He\\'s inexperienced. He was an analyst at Goldman Sachs, one of the world\\'s most successful investment banks, before working for various hedge fund firms. But that tells us nothing about whether he has the talent for leading government.\\n\\nSunak could emerge as Britain\\'s answer to France\\'s President Macron. The technocratic candidate of Davos and Goldman Sachs. He has the merit of being an homme serieux, but at 40 he is still young and unproven.\\n\\nThree scenarios\\n\\nTo sum up. The Vote Leave team which has established itself in Downing Street like an incubus won\\'t want Johnson to go. They still see him as their pliable puppet and as their best change of staying in power.\\n\\nBoris Johnson\\'s premiership is a calamity for Britain - and he knows it Peter Oborne Read More »\\n\\nBut Johnson\\'s prospects are nevertheless poor. Winter looms with a fresh wave of Covid-19, renewed economic calamity, Brexit madness and the threat of national disintegration. There is no sign at all that Johnson is capable of dealing with any of these dire problems.\\n\\nLet alone all of them at once.\\n\\nThat\\'s why I see three scenarios: a coup d\\'etat within the government which dislodges Johnson but leaves the Vote Leave team in charge.\\n\\nA coup d\\'etat which gets rid of the Vote Leave incubus as well as Johnson, leaving Sunak or Hunt to pick up the pieces in the wake of the Johnson debacle. That\\'s the best hope for the Conservatives. But it\\'s a long shot.\\n\\nThird, if the current leadership muddles on for much longer we may be facing a national crisis of such magnitude that it leads to the creation of a coalition government with the Labour leader Keir Starmer installed as prime minister.\\n\\nSuch is the scale of the current mismanagement, that may well become the best option at this dreadful time.\\n\\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.',\n",
              " 'Saudi Arabia has been trying to diversify its economy for decades, as emphasised in Vision 2030, launched by Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman.\\n\\nBut the the dual shocks of coronavirus and tumbling energy prices have hurt its plans, particularly in the non-oil sector, which is forecast to contract by 14 percent this year.\\n\\nFor your average citizen in Saudi Arabia, that means only one thing - more belt tightening. These are the key threats.\\n\\n1. Saudi Arabia can no longer rely on oil\\n\\nOil revenues account for around two-thirds of the kingdom’s exports. But while Saudi Arabia was once responsible for nearly 30 percent of global oil exports, that figure has now dropped to just 12 percent, according to Capital Economics.\\n\\nRiyadh started a price war in March in an apparent bid to damage rival producers, even as global demand was sinking due to Covid-19. It flooded the market, but in doing so saw its crude export revenues dropped by 65 percent compared to April 2019. “The sharp decline in oil prices, exacerbated by demand loss from the pandemic, has hit Saudi Arabia particularly hard,” said Boris Ivanov, founder and managing director of consultancy GPB Global Resources.\\n\\nPrices have recovered since to about $44 a barrel – but that is still well below the $77.6 a barrel that the kingdom needs to balance its budget. Nor is there any sign that it will return to those levels.\\n\\nNor is the global outlook positive: demand is projected to fall “by 8.1 million barrels a day, the largest in history” because of Covid, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Looking forward, the organisation predicts that demand will peak by 2030 due to the rise in renewable energy.\\n\\n2. Tourism won\\'t come to kingdom\\'s rescue\\n\\nSaudi Arabia had hoped that tourism would be a key part of Vision 2030, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s diversification project, with a target of 100 million visitors a year by the end of the decade.\\n\\nIn the wake of Covid-19, Riyadh is now predicting a 35-45 percent decline in tourism - equivalent to a drop in revenues of $28bn in 2020. Those numbers seem optimistic, given the global industry is predicting a fall of 58-78 percent this year.\\n\\nWhat is Saudi Arabia\\'s Vision 2030? + Show - Hide Vision 2030 was announced in 2016 with three main pillars to create a \"vibrant society, a thriving economy, and an ambitious nation.\" Out of the 33 headings in the Vision, 14 deal with the economy, 11 with social issues, and eight with adminstration. Goals range from the more prosaic - doubling the number of Saudis exercising each week, raising personal savings, and having three cities among the top 100 ranked globally – to the highly ambitious: Increase non-oil GDP from 16 percent to 50 percent\\n\\nReduce unemployment from 12 percent to 7 percent\\n\\nAttract $1 trillion in foreign investment\\n\\nAttract 1.2 million (non-religious) tourists, and 30 million pilgrims a year\\n\\nDevelop 5,000 projects, including Neom, a 26,500 sq-km, $500m futuristic city\\n\\nDevelop a $67bn minerals sector\\n\\nRaise the Public Investment Fund’s assets to $2 trillion\\n\\n“Any country depending on tourism is reassessing things in light of the pandemic,” said Bessma Momani, interim assistant vice-president, international relations, at the University of Waterloo.\\n\\nAnother setback is the decision to limit the annual Hajj to 1,000 domestic pilgrims. Umrah pilgrimages have been halted since March. “Hajj is a big money maker, and the lost revenue is needed,\" said Theodore Karasik, a senior advisor to Gulf State Analytics. “Losing it for two years in a row will hurt.”\\n\\n3. Saudi millennials: Educated and unemployed\\n\\nThe kingdom’s population has been grown fast for decades, doubling since 1990. But for Saudis born during the past 30 years, jobs are in short supply.\\n\\nAlmost two-thirds of the population are under 30 - and most of them are unemployed university graduates.\\n\\nA process of “Saudization” will see an estimated 1.2m foreign workers leave the kingdom by the end of 2020, opening up opportunities for locals – but only if businesses can survive the pandemic and its economic consequences, and are prepared to pay higher wages.\\n\\n“Saudis are far more expensive than expats,” said Rory Fyfe, managing director of MENA Advisors, “so if firms are cutting expats due to cost considerations they aren’t going to be replaced with Saudis.”\\n\\nMomani said: “This is going to be a real reckoning for the labour market. We have already seen trends of nationalisation in the labour force, and Covid will accelerate this.”\\n\\n4. Saudi Arabia citizens: Less income, more tax\\n\\nLow- to no-taxes were once a mainstay of Saudi life, only increasing in recent years as falling oil prices prompted the government to seek new ways to generate income.\\n\\nWhen Riyadh first introduced VAT and reduced fuel subsidies in 2018, it dampened the economic hit by introducing a cost of living allowance for about one million public employees, budgeted at 1,000 Riyals ($267) a month.\\n\\nBut in July, as part of austerity measures, that allowance was scrapped, saving the kingdom some $4.8 billion a year. Then VAT trebled to 15 percent. “The two will certainly have an impact on spending and hurt the economy,” said Fyfe.\\n\\nOne indication of Saudi Arabia’s declining standard of living are falling vehicle sales, which having skidded off a cliff since the last big oil price drop in 2015, when there were 800,000 car sales that year, to 400,000 in 2018. Vehicle sales are now forecast to drop by a third again in 2020 because of the latest VAT hike.\\n\\nHigher prices are particularly felt by poorer citizens, with some 2.4m receiving financial assistance, according to a UN Special Rapporteur report on extreme poverty in the kingdom, released in 2017.\\n\\nSaudi Arabia’s GDP per capita is relatively high on a global level, at $21,767. But this figure masks inequalities within the kingdom, and is significantly lower than other Gulf states, including UAE ($43,103) and Qatar ($64,782).\\n\\n5. Saudi Arabia\\'s debt is growing\\n\\nAs the world’s largest oil producer, Saudi Arabia traditionally has had no need to borrow money, so long as government spending and royal largesse did not outpace revenues.\\n\\nBut in 2015 falling oil prices forced the kingdom to turn to the international markets. That debt has increased as oil prices have remained low. Trillions of dollars are also needed to fund Vision 2030 projects.\\n\\nThis year, lower oil prices and Covid-19 prompted Saudi Arabia to borrow $26.6bn after it burned through foreign reserves and announced a stimulus package of $32bn.\\n\\nThe kingdom’s debt could rise further after the government raised its debt ceiling from 30 percent to 50 percent from 2022. As such, Saudi Arabia will now have to act like a more regular national economy in how it spends as well as raises money, such as through increasing taxes.\\n\\nOne looming danger for the kingdom is that if debt keeps rising and foreign reserves are further depleted, then the riyal’s peg to the dollar will come under pressure.\\n\\n6. Delayed: The Kingdom Tower\\n\\nIf there is one symbol of Saudi Arabia’s economic challenges then it is the unfinished $20bn Kingdom Tower, also known as the Jeddah Tower.\\n\\nA project of Saudi tycoon Prince Alwaleed bin Talal’s Kingdom Holdings, the planned 1,000m-high landmark is intended to top Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, the world’s current tallest tower.\\n\\nConstruction began in 2013 and was supposed to be completed by 2020. But only a quarter of the tower has so far been built.\\n\\nWork ground to a halt in early 2018, around the same time that bin Talal was released from three months detention in Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton Hotel, after being rounded up with dozens of other influential Saudis in a wave of arrests ordered by Mohammed bin Salman.\\n\\n“There were rumours that work was going to restart in the first quarter [of 2020], but the coronavirus pandemic may have prevented that,” said Fyfe.\\n\\n“One would think the Saudis would find it embarrassing to have a huge uncompleted building looming over Jeddah. Maybe it will be rescoped smaller and finished off eventually.”\\n\\nThis article is available in French on Middle East Eye French edition.',\n",

It can even be performed at the burial site.\\n\\nThe Fiqh Council of North America has also permitted funerals to be broadcast online, allowing those who are not able to attend to view it, as well as allowing for prayers in absentia to be carried out if the deceased is in another country.\\n\\n\"I was trying to explain to the people [at a recent funeral] that it\\'s okay if we pray the janazah while people are not standing next to each other. It\\'s okay if we do the burial while most people stand at a distance,\" Nassimi said, referring to a principle in Islam that Muslims should pray in straight lines and stand shoulder-to-shoulder.\\n\\nCremation fears\\n\\nThe UK recently issued an amendment to its coronavirus bill which would allowed for mandatory cremations should death continue to spike from the disease.\\n\\nThe process of cremation is forbidden within Islam which requires members of the faith to be buried.\\n\\nAbu Eesa Niamatullah, a Manchester-based imam, said Muslims must be prepared to accept changes should the situation get worse.\\n\\n\"We all know with our ability to cope with a large influx of deaths, especially for Muslims with the amount process that are required and the sacredness of the body, that this is a major area of concern,\" he said in a video.\\n\\nCoronavirus: UK amends emergency bill that called for mandatory cremations Read More »\\n\\nThe CDC in the US has said that individuals who have passed away, including those from Covid-19, can be either cremated or buried according to the family\\'s preference.\\n\\nStill, with the situation across the US getting progressively worse, fears are mounting that a cremation law could take effect.\\n\\n\"We\\'re really optimistic and hopeful that the Muslim community does not have to face that,\" Nassimi said.\\n\\n\"We hope that the government also cooperates and makes an exception for religious communities, like Muslims, to allow them to do it their way,\" he said.\\n\\nFor now, the faith community is adapting to the changes, and while they are causing difficulties, the key is making sure everyone understands the situation, Nassimi said.\\n\\n\"Islam has given us quite a bit of flexibility, and understanding that flexibility and following that flexibility makes it all much easier.\"\\n\\n\"When people understand, then they follow.

              " \"The removal of military commander Prince Fahd bin Turki is the latest in a series of purges carried out by the paranoid crown prince.\\n\\nThere have been at least five major purges and one mass execution in Saudi Arabia since Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) came to power as crown prince:\\n\\nMecca sermon raises questions on possible Saudi normalisation with Israel Read More »\\n\\nThese were the arrests of the Muslim scholars; the seizure of over 300 businessmen and royals rounded up in the Ritz Carlton; the campaign against women activists and human rights lawyers; the detention of leading members of the Allegiance Council and 300 government employees; and last week the removal of Prince Fahd bin Turki, commanding general of the Saudi Joint Forces and his son.\\n\\nPurges have become a permanent feature of the paranoid prince’s rule.\\n\\nHe has, of course, every reason to be paranoid, because he has made enemies of so many once powerful cousins and uncles. He has also made so many mistakes at the helm that the kingdom is today weaker militarily and economically than at any time in its modern history. Its regional prestige has shrivelled.\\n\\nPolicymaking is a shambles. On Friday Abdulrahman al-Sudais, the imam of the Grand Mosque of Mecca, preached a sermon widely interpreted as a prelude to normalisation with Israel. By Sunday King Salman told US President Donald Trump there is no normalisation without Palestinian statehood.\\n\\nThe crown prince may have reason to think the knives are out for him. But there has been a method in the madness of decrees issued in the dead of the night.\\n\\nSons and brothers\\n\\nMohammed bin Salman has paid particular attention to the rival lines of succession that have a legitimate claim to the throne should a palace coup unseat him.\\n\\nThe two branches of the family of most concern to him are the sons of the Sudairi Seven, the full brothers of his father King Salman (the sons that King Abdulaziz had with Hussa Sudairi), and the sons of the late King Abdullah, three of whom are now in detention.\\n\\nBin Turki is the last son of the Sudairi Seven of important military significance to be kicked out of office\\n\\nFahd bin Turki was in Mohammed bin Salman’s crosshairs on both counts. Bin Turki is the last son of the Sudairi Seven of important military significance to be kicked out of office. The other two members of that line, Salman’s brother Prince Ahmad and his nephew Mohammed bin Nayef, are both in detention, the targets of previous purges.\\n\\nBut if that were not enough, bin Turki’s wife Abeer is also the daughter of the late king Abdullah. Abeer is the mother of Prince Abdulaziz bin Fahd bin Turki, who was also removed from his post as deputy governor of al-Jouf region. Abeer was active on social media in her own right. She headed “The Arab Organisation for Traffic Safety” and launched a community partnership prize in her name.\\n\\nSome of the Sudairis have been kept on: Abdulaziz bin Saud bin Nayef, a grandson of Prince Nayef, was appointed interior minister. He could also have been detained during these purges, according to some reports.\\n\\nSaudi Prince Fahd bin Turki (C), then commander of the Arab Coalition, talks to US diplomat Brian Hook (L), during a visit to an army base in al-Kharj, Saudi Arabia, 21 June 2019 (AFP)\\n\\nThe sons and grandsons of Salman’s brother Sultan have also retained some influence. Faisal bin Khalid bin Sultan and Fahd bin Sultan retain two governorships, while Rima, daughter of Bandar bin Sultan, has got the Washington job, and her brother Khalid bin Bandar bin Sultan the London one.\\n\\nBut generally, the Sudairi clan is a shadow of its former self. Under King Fahd this line of the family dominated the military and intelligence posts.\\n\\nThe Abdullah clan is faring no better. Turki bin Abdullah is the only senior victim of the Carlton Ritz seizures to be still in detention almost three years on. His brothers Faisal and Meshaal have been rearrested according to some reports. Turki bin Abdullah still retains some influence and there have been appeals on social media for his release.\\n\\nYemen fallout\\n\\nMohammed bin Salman had other reasons to fear Fahd bin Turki. He was a career soldier and the popular commander of land forces. He had a reputation for being humble. As such he would have reflected the army’s disdain for the way their defence minister, the crown prince, has conducted the campaign in Yemen.\\n\\nThe campaign to displace the Houthis from Sanaa started soon after King Salman ascended the throne in January 2015. The lightning strike was supposed to signal the start of a far more activist foreign policy by the kingdom.\\n\\nFahd is known to have clashed with bin Salman over the Emirati seizure of the strategic island of Socotra and the fall of Aden to forces loyal to the Emirates\\n\\nFive years on, the pet project of the Saudi crown prince is bogged down and costing $1bn a month. The Houthis are still in Sanaa, still capable of firing missiles which can reach Riyadh, Mecca and vast swathes of Saudi territory. And the south of Yemen has been effectively partitioned by forces paid for and loyal to Abu Dhabi.\\n\\nFahd is known to have clashed with Mohammed bin Salman over the Emirati seizure of the strategic island of Socotra and the fall of Aden to forces loyal to the Emirates. MBS and his brother Khalid are veering towards a diplomatic exit, without conceding defeat. The presence of the Houthis in the capital and the seat of government in Yemen says otherwise.\\n\\nIf any more proof were needed that Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Zayed, has greater sway over a Saudi defence minister than his own top generals, there can be no more powerful sign than Fahd’s dismissal.\\n\\nFahd had also begun talking to retired generals about his dissatisfaction, Saudi sources inform me. It is impossible to know how far this went or whether the activity was picked up by MBS’ comprehensive surveillance network.\\n\\nThe wrong signal\\n\\nThe message that these continued purges sends to the region is the wrong one. The crown prince needs to present the image of a kingdom that is stable under his full control. Particularly at a time when Saudi Arabia has come under pressure by its major shareholders, US President Donald Trump and his son-in-law and Special Adviser Jared Kushner, to normalise relations with Israel.\\n\\nMohammed bin Salman wants to avoid giving signs of weakness and mayhem. If chaos reigns, a deal with him alone over Israel (he has met the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in person several times) is not worth the paper it is written on, because it will not have the buy in from the rest of the royal clan.\\n\\nIsrael-UAE deal: Saudi king presses Trump for a 'fair' Palestinian solution Read More »\\n\\nNetanyahu must surely know that if Mohammed bin Salman is brought down, all Israel’s efforts to bring the kingdom in line on the Palestinian question will go with him.\\n\\nThe Saudi policy on Israel will surely revert to the old status quo of the Arab Peace Initiative of 2002, which was a Saudi production and singular foreign policy achievement of King Abdullah, beginning when he was crown prince.\\n\\nWhether Fahd represented a genuine threat, or whether the general was victim of another bout of the prince’s midnight paranoia makes little difference. The signal it sends is of permanent insecurity at the highest levels of the royal family.\\n\\nPermanent insecurity is personified by Mohammed bin Salman himself, working through the night, plotting, suspecting, lashing out, without thought to the consequences.\\n\\nThe purge announced last week is still continuing. More Muslim scholars have been arrested, including Sheikh Dr Abdullah Basfar, a preacher noted for the mellifluous voice with which he read out passages from the Quran. He was politically unaffiliated.\\n\\nMohammed bin Salman can never sleep in peace. That is his problem.

Read More »\\n\\nThe 91-year-old linguist, philosopher and emeritus professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) says Israel was seen 20 years ago as the \"noblest country in the world\" and Palestinians were dismissed as a \"bunch of terrorists\".\\n\\n\"There\\'s something to bear in mind about this: Public opinion on Israel-Palestine has shifted radically,\" Chomsky said. Now, he says, a debate is opening in the mainstream left about the conflict, while strong support for Israel has become limited mostly to the ultra-nationalist right and Christian evangelicals.\\n\\n\"Israel used to be the darling of the left liberals. Support for Israel was based in the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. Left intellectuals were in love with Israel. Israel was the recipient of accolades and praise like no other country in the world at the time. That has changed dramatically. By now, most people who identify as liberal Democrats are more sympathetic to the Palestinians than Israel.\"\\n\\nChomsky said bringing Democratic politicians in line with their supporters\\' views on the conflict would have real-world implications.\\n\\n\"There\\'s an opportunity in one of the two parties to get the mood to reflect the changing opinions of their popular base and move towards very different policies towards the Middle East,\" Chomsky said.\\n\\nChomsky makes case for Biden\\n\\nAs the US public grows increasingly sceptical of Israel, American policies have never been more supportive of the Israeli government.\\n\\nUnder Trump, Washington moved the US embassy to Jerusalem, cut aid to Palestinian refugees and most recently signalled that it will accept the new Israeli government\\'s plans to annex large parts of the West Bank.\\n\\nChomsky lambasted Trump\\'s pro-Israel policies, including the proposal to end the conflict, which was prepared by the US president\\'s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and released in January. The scheme, dubbed the \\'deal of the century\\', would allow Israel to keep all of its settlements in the West Bank, while Palestinians would get a disjointed state without armed forces or sovereignty over its borders and airspace.\\n\\n\"The Trump administration is way to the right of any past government - the most reactionary - and anyone in the world on the Palestinian issue,\" Chomsky said. \"The famous \\'deal of the century\\' was written by Netanyahu handed to the little baby-faced guy, Trump\\'s son-in-law, and he gave it to the world.\"\\n\\nThe professor, who has published more than 120 books on various subjects including scathing critiques of US foreign policy, said the worst outcome for Palestinians would be another term for Trump, despite Biden\\'s staunch support for Israel.\\n\\n\"With a Trump administration in for another four years, it\\'s going to be very difficult to do anything. In fact, we might not even survive, but that\\'s another story,\" Chomsky said.\\n\\n\\'There\\'s an opportunity in one of the two parties to get the mood to reflect the changing opinions of their popular base and move towards very different policies towards the Middle East\\'\\n\\n\"But on issues like this, you can\\'t press the Trump administration. In the past, it was possible to influence Republican administrations. Reagan, Nixon - awful people, but they were sort of half-human. You deal with them as human beings.\\n\\n\"We\\'re now dealing with a gang of psychopathic maniacs. It\\'s off the spectrum of traditional parliamentary politics, something new.\"\\n\\nCompared to the Trump White House, Chomsky said a Biden administration will be \"susceptible to pressure\" from organisers, especially that a large part of the voting base of the Democratic Party is open to the idea of holding Israel accountable for its human rights abuses.\\n\\nChomsky went on to make an unambiguous case for voting for Biden in November.\\n\\n\"What does it mean to say you can\\'t vote for the lesser of two evils, that means: I\\'m going to vote for the greater of two evils,\" Chomsky said.\\n\\nHe warned people considering voting for a third-party candidate that they should think about the consequences of the election on the human race even if it means \"holding your nose\" and voting for Biden.\\n\\nChomsky said that in a two-horse race, every vote that does not go to the former vice president will benefit the current occupant of the White House. \"If you abstain or vote for someone else, you\\'re essentially voting for Trump. Is that what your conscience tells you to do?\"\\n\\nTargeting aid to Israel\\n\\nSeveral Palestinian rights activists who backed Sanders told MEE early in April that the suspension of the senator\\'s presidential campaign will not be the end of their struggle for justice and equality.\\n\\nAnd Chomsky says there is fertile ground for activism around Palestine in the United States now more than ever. He called for exploiting the legal vulnerabilities of US aid to Israel.\\n\\n\"Activists should be pressing on the weak points of the US government\\'s support for Israel. It\\'s based on crucial lies,\" Chomsky said.\\n\\n\"Why doesn\\'t the United States admit that Israel has a nuclear weapons programme? Of course, everybody knows it. But the US can\\'t concede it. Why? Because if they do concede it, serious questions arise about whether all US aid to Israel is illegal under US law.\"\\n\\n\\'What does it mean to say you can\\'t vote for the lesser of two evils, that means: I\\'m going to vote for the greater of two evils\\'\\n\\nSection 101 of the US Arms Export Control Act explicitly bans foreign aid, including military assistance to countries that acquire nuclear enrichment or materials outside the scrutiny of the international community.\\n\\nIsrael\\'s covert nuclear weapons programme is an open secret in the region, but Washington has never officially acknowledged it.\\n\\nThe United States gives about $3.8bn in military aid to Israel annually, funds that are crucial to sustaining the Israeli army.\\n\\nChomsky also called for bringing up the Leahy Law, which prohibits military aid to countries engaged in gross violations of human rights.\\n\\n\"What activists ought to be doing is pressing to follow US law to terminate all aid to Israel. That sounds like a stretch, but it\\'s not,\" Chomsky said.\\n\\n\"For one thing, a large part of the country will probably agree with that already.

The visitor is then taken into the world of modern commerce and capitalism, in which the lives of working class Jews are often obscured and antisemitic conspiracies about the world being run by a cabal of malign Jewish bankers continue to infect the political discourse from the United States to the Middle East and beyond.\\n\\nJudas, silver and betrayal\\n\\nThe story begins, more or less, during the time of Jesus, and the fate of his disciple Judas Iscariot, who the Bible says betrayed Jesus to the Jewish chief priests in exchange for 30 pieces of silver.\\n\\nJudas Returning The Thirty Pieces Of Silver (1629) by Rembrandt van Rijn (The National Gallery, London)\\n\\nLike Jesus and his fellow disciples, Judas was Jewish, but from the 12th century onward, he began to be transformed into a personification of all Jews at a time when many Jews in Europe were pushed into unpopular economic roles such as usury (lending money for interest), which the dominant Catholic church regarded as sinful.\\n\\nBetrayal Of Christ, a Dutch work from around 1650. Note Judas\\' red hair and yellow cloak (Victoria & Albert Museum)\\n\\nThis personification was not kind: Judas became known as the archetypal traitor, a symbol of greed and heresy. He was the man who stood on the wrong side of the Bible’s line: in the Book of Matthew, “it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God”.\\n\\nJudas was attached to material wealth, not spirituality, wedded to this world rather than the world to come. Crude depictions of the disciple, who had been shown by others to be Jesus’s closest confidante, presented him as a ghoulishly Jewish caricature of evil and greed, complete with a money bag, bright yellow cloak and red hair.\\n\\nSome aspects of his appearance have continued to have symbolic resonance. The colour yellow was used to distinguish Jews (and other non-Muslims) from Muslims in the Umayyad Caliphate, and Jews and Muslims were during certain periods required to wear distinguishing clothing in Catholic-dominated medieval Europe. The yellow star branded Jews as having betrayed Jesus, a branding that was re-introduced by the Nazis.\\n\\nThe jewel in the crown of the Jewish Museum’s exhibition is a beautiful, beguiling and far more complex portrait of Judas. Rembrandt’s Judas Repentant, Returning the Thirty Pieces of Silver (1629) shows the disciple trying to return the money he has taken in exchange for his act of betrayal.\\n\\nKneeling on the ground, his hands clasped together, scalp bloodied from tearing his hair out in anguish, Judas is tormented by what he’s done - and yet still his eyes seem to meet the money he has thrown to the ground. The deadly pull of the silver is not quite extinguished. The priests are unmoved. They refuse Judas. He leaves the temple and hangs himself.\\n\\nA game of hate\\n\\nIn the medieval and early modern period, the figure of the Jewish moneylender was more often represented in a way that recalls the crude depictions of Judas with moneybag and red beard.\\n\\nThe New And Fashionable Game Of The Jew, a children\\'s toy (Jewish Museum London)\\n\\nThis was despite the fact that it was not only Jews who worked as money lenders, even though lending money at interest was sinful in Judaism as well as in Christianity.\\n\\nThe role was often taken on by Jews because the antisemitic societies they found themselves in brought forward little in the way of alternative occupation.\\n\\nThis concept of the Jewish moneylender in Europe, most famously embodied by Shylock in Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice (first performed in 1605) and later by Charles Dickens’ Fagin in Oliver Twist (1839), is shown to be at the heart of associations between Jews and money, as artefact after artefact attests.\\n\\nFrom 1807, a children’s dice game called The New and Fashionable Game of the Jew comes with an illustration of an old man in a turban, a stereotypical Jewish banker in fine robes hoarding his money, prepared to rip off all those good Gentile boys and girls with his tricky ways. Stephen Sondheim, the Jewish-American composer, owns a copy and describes it as the game that “taught kids to be antisemitic”.\\n\\nA few years earlier, in 1798, Nathan Mayer Rothschild disembarked in London from Germany. The new arrival was to become phenomenally successful, establishing the first branch of the Rothschild family bank and going on to finance a series of British military campaigns.\\n\\nThe sculpture of him by Jean-Pierre Dantan is one of many gruesomely antisemitic works of art on display at the exhibition, the Jewish banker shown as a grossly dehumanised figure, all rolls of fat, engorged lips and bulging eyes.\\n\\nRothschild’s rise to power started the theories of influence surrounding his family that continue today and which have proliferated on YouTube and social media.\\n\\nJean-Pierre Dantan\\'s sculpture of Nathan Mayer Rothschild: note how the figure clasps his money bags, with coins strewn all over (MEE/Oscar Rickett)\\n\\nThe development of commerce in the 18th and 19th centuries transformed the economic status of some Jews, leading to the rise of two prominent and contradictory stereotypes: that of the Jewish banker and that of the Jewish beggar.\\n\\nAnxiety and disgust with the cruelty of capitalism could too easily be distorted into antisemitism, with figures like Rothschild used as representatives of a system that ground down millions of people not simply because they were powerful capitalists, but because they were Jewish. Some of those victims of capitalism were, of course, Jews themselves and often economic migrants living precarious lives.\\n\\nBut stereotypes are not rational: at the same time as Jews were being shown as grotesquely wealthy capitalist pigs, they were also being depicted as hopelessly devious beggars, leeching off society.\\n\\nRace and capital\\n\\nAs the spectre of communism came to haunt Europe, the same trick was pulled: Jews were rich capitalists yet were also devious Bolsheviks, intent on overthrowing the good and natural order of things.\\n\\nIn 1930s Germany, the Nazis made headway with both these stereotypes as they rose to power, decrying communism as another form of Jewish conspiracy while in the same breath assaulting Jews for taking bread off the table of good honest Aryan folk.\\n\\nNor was it just in Germany: in 1933, an entry from the Oxford English Dictionary listed one of the definitions of the word “Jew” as “to cheat”.\\n\\nThese myths and stereotypes persist.

              " 'Plague, pandemic and pestilence have long been themes for writers, historians and poets, from Giovanni Boccaccio’s medieval The Decameron and Daniel Defoe’s A Journal of the Plague Year to, more recently, Blindness by Nobel Prize winner Jose Saramago.\\n\\nNowhere is this more true than the Middle East and North Africa, which has a centuries-old tradition of writing about illness and medicine.\\n\\nIn pictures: Coronavirus and the Middle East Read More »\\n\\nOne of the most famous works is The Plague, by French-Algerian writer Albert Camus. Published in 1947, it is set in the Algerian city of Oran and based on the cholera epidemic which engulfed the city in 1849 (Camus chose to set his novel in the modern age). Many have also interpreted the story as about resistance to the Nazi occupation during World War Two.\\n\\nThat same year, Nazik al-Malaika broke poetry convention with her account of cholera in Cairo; one thousand years earlier, Ibn al-Wardi railed against the plague through an ode, only to succumb himself to the disease two days later.\\n\\nBut epidemic-related work from the region is not just fictional, going beyond the artistic and impressionist to also include hygiene guidance, travel books and hadiths (sayings, actions or silent approval attributed to the Prophet Muhammad and used as guidance for everyday life).\\n\\nWorks by the ninth-century writer Ibn Abi al-Dunya, as well as later works by Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani gave guidance on how to combat disease - much as we, in the 21st century, look to the World Health Organisation and other expert bodies for guidance.\\n\\n1947: Cholera in Egypt\\n\\nCholera, by the Iraqi poet Nazik al-Malaika (1923-2007), depicts the death, grief and agony that shattered Egypt during the last months of 1947.\\n\\nThe 1947 cholera outbreak dominated Egyptian media of the day.\\n\\nThe outbreak, which hit the country hard, is considered one of the largest incidents of the disease in Egypt during the 20th century, killing around 10,276 people out of a 20,805 recorded cases. During this period Egypt was cut off from the rest of the world, amid restrictions on travel, and the forceful isolation of patients and communities.\\n\\nAlthough the origin of the infection was never proven, many Egyptians believed it was bought in by English soldiers returning from India (Egypt, which was a British colony earlier in the century, was still heavily garrisoned with UK troops during the late 1940s).\\n\\nAl-Malaika conjures up vivid images of carriages carrying dead bodies and the silence that befell Egyptian streets; she also uses colloquial phrases for the illness such as “al-Shota” and “al-Heyda”, which translate as \"swift\" and \"quick\".\\n\\nHer style was hailed by critics at the time as ground-breaking in its use of free verse rather than the traditional Arabic ode, a form which is now almost 1,500 years old. As such, Cholera heralded a new chapter in Arabic poetry and inspired a new wave of Arab poets - called the Pioneer Generation - to experiment with different forms. During the 1990s, al-Malaika moved to Cairo, where she spent her last years.\\n\\nIt is dawn.\\n\\nListen to the footsteps of the passerby,\\n\\nin the silence of the dawn.\\n\\nListen, look at the mourning processions,\\n\\nten, twenty, no… countless.\\n\\n…\\n\\nEverywhere lies a corpse, mourned\\n\\nwithout a eulogy or a moment of silence.\\n\\n…\\n\\nHumanity protests against the crimes of death.\\n\\n…\\n\\nCholera is the vengeance of death.\\n\\n…\\n\\nEven the gravedigger has succumbed,\\n\\nthe muezzin is dead,\\n\\nand who will eulogize the dead?\\n\\n…\\n\\nO Egypt, my heart is torn by the ravages of death.\\n\\nTranslated by Husain Haddawy, with Nathalie Handal in Poetry of Arab Women: A Contemporary Anthology\\n\\n1784: Plague in North Africa\\n\\nThe popular depiction of pandemics has focused on outbreaks such as the medieval Black Death or the influenza outbreak 0f 1917-1920, which is wrongly labelled “Spanish Flu”. But epidemics can also be localised.\\n\\nThe plague was responsible for exacerbating tensions between Sfax and Venice: here, forces under the command of Angelo Emo bombard the Tunisian port (top left)\\n\\nThe volumes Ten Years\\' Residence at the Court of Tripoli were penned by a “Miss Tully”, the sister-in-law of Richard Tully, the British consul in Tripoli, from 1784 onwards.\\n\\nThe port city, in modern-day Libya, was hit by the plague in 1785. Tully writes of how burning straw was used in homes as fumigation - along with what we would now recognise as social distancing:\\n\\n“A friend is admitted only into a matted apartment, where he retires to the farther end of the room to a straw seat. No business is now transacted but with a blaze of straw kept burning between the person admitted into the house and the one he is speaking to.”\\n\\nBut the situation was just as severe in what is modern-day Tunisia. On 29 April 1785, Tully wrote:\\n\\nThe last few weeks several couriers have crossed the deserts from Tunis to this city, disseminating the plague in their way; and consequently the country round us is everywhere infected.\\n\\nThe plague reached the Tunisian city of Sfax in 1784 and was to kill an estimated 15,000 people, this in a port city of 30,000, double that of Tripoli.\\n\\nSfax had previously been hit by plague in 1622 and again in 1688, but the outbreak almost a century later was even more lethal, wiping out many of the ruling classes, including officials, politicians, the legal profession - and poets.\\n\\nIt began when sea merchants arrived after escaping the plague in Alexandria to the east. They were refused entry to Sfax but some sailors managed to breach the order.\\n\\nLater, war was to follow plague. A Venetian merchant vessel was set alight by forces under the bey - or ruler - of Tunis, amid fears it had been infected with the plague. From autumn 1784 onwards and the following year, the Venetian fleet bombarded cities including Sfax.\\n\\n1349: Pestilence in Syria\\n\\nIbn al-Wardi (1292-1349), a Syrian historian, was born in Maarat al-Numan. He wrote vividly about the Black Death, which swept through the world during the mid 14th-century, from Asia into the Middle East and then on to Europe.\\n\\nA map of the world from the 14th century by Ibn al Wardi (Library of Congress)\\n\\nAl-Wardi was living in Aleppo when the plague reached there in 1349, devastating the city for 15 years and claiming around 1,000 lives every day. His An Essay on the Report of the Pestilence, is a historical account of its impact on the Levante.\\n\\nThe plague began in the land of darkness. China was not preserved from it. The plague infected the Indians in India, the Sind, the Persians, and the Crimea. The plague destroyed mankind in Cairo. It stilled all movement in Alexandria.\\n\\nThen, the plague turned to Upper Egypt. The plague attacked Gaza, trapped Sidon, and Beirut. Next, it directed its shooting arrows to Damascus. There the plague sat like a lion on a throne and swayed with power, killing daily one thousand or more and destroying the population.\\n\\nOh God, it is acting by Your command. Lift this from us. It happens where You wish; keep the plague from us.\\n\\nAl-Wardi also wrote two poetry verses about the pandemic:\\n\\nI do not scare from Black Death as others\\n\\nIt is but a martyrdom or victory\\n\\nIf I died, I rested from the rivalries\\n\\nAnd If I lived, my eye and ear heald\\n\\nHe died two days later from the Black Death, which causes inflammation of glands on the neck, armpit and groin.\\n\\n10th century: Fever in Egypt\\n\\nNight Visitor, the ode by Iraqi-Syrian poet al-Mutannabi (915-965) to fever, is widely considered one the masterpieces of classical Arabic poetry.\\n\\nAl Azhar mosque and and university in Cairo: construction began shortly after Iraqi-Syrian poet al-Mutannabi lived in the city\\n\\nBorn in Kufa, Iraq, as Ahmed bin al-Hussein al-Kindi, al-Mutannabi’s nickname translates as \"he who would be a prophet”. He treated poetry with zeal and relied on senses and experiences rather than mere abstractions for his inspiration.\\n\\nNight Visitor depicts the condition as a shy lover, sneaking into Mutannabi’s bed after dark. The reader can viscerally feel and see this unwelcome guest, as the verse creates a sense of how fever makes its victim delirious, sweaty and fatigued.\\n\\nMutannabi\\'s metaphors and play on language poem were unique at the time, not least the idea of the fever - which is never medically specified - as a night visitor.\\n\\nMutannabi was under stress when he wrote the poem in Egypt, having just fallen out with best friend Sayf al-Dawla, the ruler of Aleppo, after intellectual in-fighting at the royal court. He was killed by bandits in 965 while travelling from Ahvaz in modern-day Iran. His influence at the time was such that news of his death reverberated like thunder around the Muslim world.\\n\\nFor she does not pay her visits save under cover of darkness,\\n\\nI freely offered her my linen and my pillows,\\n\\nBut she refused them, and spent the night in my bones.\\n\\nMy skin is too contracted to contain both my breath and her,\\n\\nSo she relaxes it with all sorts of sickness.\\n\\nWhen she leaves me, she washes me\\n\\nAs though we had retired apart for some forbidden action.\\n\\nIt is as though the morning drives her away,\\n\\nAnd her lachrymal ducts are flooded in their four channels.\\n\\nI watch for her time without desire,\\n\\nYet with the watchfulness of the eager lover.\\n\\nTaken from Arabian Medicine: The FitzPatrick Lectures Delivered at the College of Physicians in November 1919 and November 1920\\n\\n9th century: Guidance in Iraq\\n\\nOne of the earliest scholars to write a book about the Black Death was the Iraqi Ibn Abi al-Dunya (823-894). Revered as a teacher, he tutored the Abbasid caliphs, who ruled territory extending across North Africa, the Arabian peninsula, the Levant and modern-day Iran and Afghanistan.\\n\\nThe Abbasid caliph Al-Ma\\'mun (left), who ruled during the early years of al-Dunya’s life, was a strong supporter of scholarship, from a 12th/13th-century manuscript (Madrid National Library)\\n\\nDuring the early centuries of Islam, little was written about pestilence: until the ninth century, no serious scholar had dedicated a book to the subject or suggested measures to take to avoid contagion.\\n\\nIbn Abi al-Dunya was the first to change that: that he had access to the most powerful rulers of the time meant that his word carried weight (he was, in effect, the closest that Baghdad had to the WHO).\\n\\nIn The Book of Pestilences he included a hadith about fever:\\n\\nThe Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, entered the home of Umm Sa’ib and he said, “What ails you, O Umm Sa’ib? You are shivering.”\\n\\nShe said: “It is a fever. Allah has not blessed it.”\\n\\nThe Prophet said: “Do not curse fever. Verily, it removes the sins of the children of Adam, just as a furnace removes dirt from iron.”\\n\\nThe Book of Illness and Atonements, meanwhile, gives examples of how people recovered from illness, including the Prophet Muhammad, during the early days of Islam.\\n\\nHis work was later cited by Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani (1372-1449), born in the Palestinian town of Askalan, who became a noted scholar in Cairo, one of the Middle East’s major seats of learning.\\n\\nHis book Offering Almsgiving in the Grace of Pestilence, was to prove one of the most popular works on the Black Death, which had just swept the eastern hemisphere.\\n\\n639: Hadiths in Palestine\\n\\nThe Palestinian village of Emmaus lies between Jerusalem and Ramleh.

As a result, Muslim scholars wrote about what the plague was, steps that residents should take, the best food to eat, personal hygiene and how to move from city to city.\\n\\nOne of the widely cited hadiths of Prophet Muhammad in books about plagues, advises:\\n\\nIf you hear of an outbreak of plague in a land, do not enter it; but if the plague outbreaks out in a place while you are in it, do not leave that place.\\n\\nAnother hadith read:\\n\\nThose with contagious diseases should be kept away from those who are healthy\\n\\nIsolation and staying at home: as relevant now as they were 1,400 years ago.\\n\\nThis article is available in French on Middle East Eye French edition.',\n",

September 2015 - Mosque visits by extremists groups spark protests\\n\\nWhen Israel captured East Jerusalem in 1967 and began its occupation, it reached an agreement with the Islamic endowment authority, the Waqf, which administered the site, that it would not allow non-Muslim prayer on the site of Al-Aqsa mosque.\\n\\nThat commitment has been tested in recent decades as Jewish and other non-Muslim groups attempt to make more frequent visits to the site.\\n\\nDamage at Al-Aqsa mosque in 2015 after Israeli forces forcibly evacuated some worshippers, while barricading others inside the mosque (MEE)\\n\\nBy 2015, Jewish extremist groups were making more frequent visits to the complex, which were preceded by the removal of Muslim worshippers from the site by Israeli forces.\\n\\nThis raised Palestinian fears that the Israelis were going to renege on the deal, and when on one Sunday in September 2015, worshippers were removed from the compound after dawn prayers in order to allow a visit by right-wing Israelis, protests immediately broke out.

              " 'Ten years ago, I walked down a tiled pathway in Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood and was led into a room where an old woman was sitting amid a pile of boxes and packed suitcases.\\n\\nWhat kept Rifqa al-Kurd there, sitting among her boxes? She gave a one word reply: \\'Sumud\\', which roughly translates as steadfastness\\n\\nThe first thing I noticed about Rifqa al-Kurd was the burning intensity of her eyes. She told me that she lived out of boxes because she was expecting the police to throw her out of house and for the settlers to move in at any moment. When that happened, she explained, she did not want her clothes thrown into the street. Hence the packed bags.\\n\\nShe had been through this before, when she was evicted from her home in Haifa in 1948. What kept her there, sitting among her boxes? She gave a one word reply: \"Sumud\", which roughly translates as steadfastness.\\n\\nRifqa died last year, still in the home that had been given to her by the Jordanian government and UNWRA. Her son Nabil explained to me how settlers had moved into an extension he built, which the municipal authorities said was illegal.\\n\\nNabil, somewhat greyer now, has taken his mother’s place standing picket outside their house, number 13, next to a wall, graffitied with \"We will not leave\" in Arabic. His daughter and Rifqa’s granddaughter, Mona al-Kurd, filmed the video that has since gone viral of Jewish settlers with thick Brooklyn accents barging their way into her home: \"If I don’t steal your home, someone else will steal it,\" one said.\\n\\nFar from over\\n\\nWhen I met the al-Kurd family and wrote about Rifqa, no one took the slightest notice of her or Sheikh Jarrah. I had to explain to my editor where Sheikh Jarrah was and even then, I don’t think he got it. The Arab Spring was the only story in town, and not for the first time, Palestinians were told their conflict was old news.\\n\\nIsraeli settler’s attempt to justify forcible takeover of a Palestinian home sparks online anger Read More »\\n\\nToday, Sheikh Jarrah is the subject of statements from the UN, the US State Department, and politicians across the spectrum in Britain. Demonstrations are being held in Downing Street, Chicago and Berlin. And Mona al-Kurd has a global online audience. So, I can personally attest to one fact about the last few days of mayhem in Sheikh Jarrah, Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Damascus Gate: Israel is far from done with the Palestinian conflict.\\n\\nLast year, Israel\\'s national religious right proclaimed that it had won this conflict and that the Palestinians should do the decent thing, and come out waving a white flag. Former US President Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel turned the opening of the US embassy partly into an evangelical service, partly into a victory parade. \"What a glorious day for Israel. We are in Jerusalem and we are here to stay,\" Jared Kushner proclaimed at the opening ceremony. In Gaza on the same day, as Kushner crowed, more than 50 people were killed by Israeli forces.\\n\\nThen came the so-called Abraham Accords when the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain normalised relations with Israel.\\n\\nIn an op-ed in the New York Times and in reply to the late Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian chief negotiator, Israel’s then UN ambassador Danny Danon wrote: \"What’s wrong with Palestinian surrender? …A national suicide of the Palestinians’ current political and cultural ethos is precisely what is needed for peace.\"\\n\\nRifqa al-Kurd with her granddaughter Mona al-Kurd at their house in Sheikh Jarrah (Supplied)\\n\\nBut if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thought then he could bury the Palestinian state by dealing with the Emirati or Bahraini one, by getting Sudan taken off the terrorist list, or having Washington recognise Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara, he must now be realising how little that meant, how little in reality his newly acquired Arab assets are worth.\\n\\nEnough is enough\\n\\nThese Arab leaders have no credibility with their own people, even less with the Palestinians. To ever have thought otherwise was Netanyahu’s grand illusion. A new generation of Palestinians is rising under his nose, which no amount of skunk water, tear gas, and sound grenades will stop. There is a Mona al-Kurd on every street corner.\\n\\nArab leaders have no credibility with their own people, even less with Palestinians. To ever have thought otherwise was Netanyahu’s grand illusion\\n\\nHow did they get there? Who raised them? Who incited them?\\n\\nThe soldiers who arrest them nightly; the courts which have decided settlers are the true owners of their homes, or who issue the demolition orders; the city municipality which carries them out; The City of David Foundation, El Ad, which advances territorial claims through archaeology and housing for settlers in Silwan; the mobs of far-right Jewish youths who shout: \"Death to the Arabs\"; or the city’s deputy mayor Arieh King, who told a Palestinian activist that it was a pity he wasn’t shot in the head.\\n\\nThis education in hatred is the result of a truly multi-disciplinary effort by Israel\\'s different institutions and at all levels. It has gone on all their lives. Now this generation is saying: \"Enough is enough.\" To them, it matters not how many times Israeli police throw sound grenades at medics treating the injured, at worshippers inside Al-Aqsa mosque or at women and children in the streets of the Old City.\\n\\nThey will return night after night to Al-Aqsa. Without a stone being thrown, their presence proves that East Jerusalem is under occupation and will always be so until liberated from Israeli control. But stones will be thrown and much else besides. There were large demonstrations in the West Bank and a volley of rockets fired from Gaza. On Tuesday, 25 Palestinians, including nine children, were killed in Israeli air strikes on the enclave. Two Israeli women have also died.\\n\\nIf the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas talks and behaves like a rabbit caught in the headlights, faced with a people he has lost all authority over, the same is not true of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.\\n\\nNo matter how many times Israeli police clear the mosque, and they have now done it twice, it will refill with Palestinian worshippers (Reuters)\\n\\nKey features\\n\\nThere are three features that give this protest added potency, and that should cause alarm to the Israeli security establishment. The first is that as a direct result of the latest wave of normalisations with Israel, no Palestinian is under any illusion that an Arab state will come to even their rhetorical rescue.\\n\\nJerusalem is ready to explode - the world can\\'t say it wasn\\'t warned Read More »\\n\\nThis was not the case in previous intifadas. There are no honest brokers any more. The Palestinians know they are well and truly on their own, and each can only rely on the resources available to them.\\n\\nThe second is that unlike previous uprisings, every Palestinian is involved. From 1948, Jerusalem, the West Bank, Gaza and the diaspora. The protests in al-Aqsa attract Christians as well as Muslims, secular as well as religious, nationalist as well as Islamist. They come from Haifa and Jaffa as well as Jerusalem.\\n\\nIf the buses carrying them are stopped on the motorway, Jerusalemites come and pick them up in their cars. They have different status under Israeli law. Some have Israeli passports and are citizens, others have Jerusalem resident permits. Israel has undone all of the work it put into the strategy of divide and rule. It has united them all.\\n\\nAll feel the same fire and express the same passion. All call themselves Palestinian. Each and everyone of them knows what the stakes are.\\n\\nThe third and crucial difference is that this movement is centred on Al-Aqsa and Jerusalem. No matter how many times the police clear the mosque, and they have now done it three times, it will refill with Palestinians more determined to protect it by stepping into the shoes of those who have been injured or arrested.\\n\\nA new uprising\\n\\nPicking Jerusalem as the place to declare an end of conflict last year was the most fundamental error Netanyahu and the settlers could have made. Of course they can use, and have used, maximum force, but they will learn to question the utility of doing so.\\n\\nBy making East Jerusalem the focus of the next round of settlement, and openly and brazenly justifying it, Israel ignited a flame that can only grow throughout the Muslim world\\n\\nBy making East Jerusalem the focus of the next round of settlement, and openly and brazenly justifying it, they have ignited a flame that can only grow throughout the Muslim world. And it\\'s a flame they can not control. No one expressed this more fiercely or eloquently on Monday than Um Samir Abdellatif, an elderly resident of one of the 28 homes threatened with eviction in Sheikh Jarrah.\\n\\nIn an interview with Al Jazeera on Monday, Um Samir said she knew the Arab world could not do anything for them. \"But we do not lean on anyone, because we will, with our own hands, resist the occupation. God willing, we will keep resisting until the very last moment of our lives.\\n\\n\"My heart is on fire from the amount of hypocrisy and claims that these lands are theirs. And they know, with every fibre of their beings, that what they are saying is lies. This is Zionism, it has nothing to do with Judaism. People say that we fight against Judaism, but we don’t, we always have good relations with Christians and Jews, we have always been good with each other.

The young Palestinians responded with firecrackers and confronted the police.\\n\\nPolice Commissioner-General Yaakov Shabtai, appointed in late 2020 by the right-wing minister of homeland security, Amir Ohana, has little experience of regular and traditional policing.\\n\\n\\'Netanyahu, who realised that he was playing with fire, instructed the police to try and defuse the tension. But once again it was too late to avoid the slippery slope\\'\\n\\nThroughout his professional career, he had served in the Border Police, a force known for its racism against West Bank Palestinians and Palestinian citizens of Israel. His anti-liberal and right-wing views are well known in Israel.\\n\\nHis appointment was approved and even encouraged by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is now leading a transitional government.\\n\\nShin Bet decided to intervene to return calm to the streets of Jerusalem and forced Shabtai to remove the barricades. But it was too late. The damage was done.\\n\\nHamas felt that Israel caved into the pressure and increased its threats and defiant rhetoric inciting violence. Meanwhile, Israeli police forces carried out raids inside al-Aqsa mosque and attacked worshippers.\\n\\nThe next move was also an unwise decision by the police.\\n\\nTo please his political masters, Ohana and Netanyahu, Shabtai allowed an annual event known as \"the flags dance\" to go ahead, despite the growing tension.\\n\\nThe event is an annual demonstration by ultra-nationalist right-wingers and Israeli settlers who march through the Muslim quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem.\\n\\nEventually, the police commissioner once again surrendered to pressure from Shin Bet and ordered a change in the march\\'s route. Netanyahu, who realised he was playing with fire, instructed the police to try and defuse tension. But once again it was too late to avoid the slippery slope.\\n\\nUltimatum from Gaza\\n\\nHamas and the Islamic Jihad movement on Monday evening gave the Israeli police an ultimatum to leave the al-Aqsa Mosque complex. Israel could not allow itself to surrender to such a demand. To prove that its word was its bond, Hamas launched seven rockets in the direction of Jerusalem and its rural surroundings.\\n\\nLive: Dozens dead in Gaza as rights groups condemn Israeli actions Read More »\\n\\nThe Israeli army, led by Lieutenant-General Aviv Kochavi, ordered the bombing of Hamas and Islamic Jihad military sites in Gaza. But as is always the case with Israeli air strikes, Palestinian civilians, including children, were killed. The Israeli army also renewed its campaign of targeted killing against commanders in Gaza.\\n\\nThe two armed groups retaliated with a barrage of rockets shot towards Israeli cities, notably Ashkelon and Ashdod and rural communities in the south.\\n\\nSmall groups of Palestinian citizens of Israel in mixed Jewish-Palestinian towns, such as Jaffa, Haifa, Ramlah and Lod, have demonstrated in solidarity with Gaza.\\n\\nA mere 24 hours after the beginning of Israel\\'s campaign against the besieged strip, dozens of Palestinians have been killed and wounded, and dozens of buildings destroyed. Meanwhile, two Israeli women were killed and houses damaged as 300 rockets were fired from Gaza.\\n\\nOn each side, both Kochavi and Hamas leaders continue with their harsh and threatening language. And yet it seems that both sides are still showing some restraint. Hamas and Islamic Jihad had not shot at Tel Aviv until Tuesday evening, while the Israeli army appears - as yet - to have no intention of crossing the border to invade Gaza.\\n\\nIn the meantime, as in past rounds between Israel and Gaza, Egypt, Qatar and Turkey will try to broker a ceasefire.

It’s one of the busiest times of the year for Muslims: in many parts of the Middle East, mosques fill up with worshippers. It’s not unusual for streets and parks to be lined with prayer mats and speakers to be placed outside to cater for the overflow of people.\\n\\nHowever, this year many will pray at home because of mosque closures as a result of the pandemic.\\n\\nMany theme parks and entertainment venues will remain closed to curb the spread of Covid-19 (Khalid al-Mousily/Reuters)\\n\\nIn the UK, current government and local authority guidance does not allow for outdoor congregations in public spaces.\\n\\nIn Egypt, a surge in Covid-19 cases and fears of a third wave of the pandemic has meant that the government has introduced new restrictions ahead of Eid. According to local media, a two-week reduction of hours for the opening of commercial and entertainment venues will be put in place. All public gatherings, entertainment shows and mass activities will also be completely banned in the two-week period.\\n\\nIn Turkey, Eid will come amid a national lockdown as cases have continued to rise.

Typically, Muslims will wear new clothes, either traditional dress or the best clothes that they own.\\n\\nHomes are decorated elaborately and intricately to welcome the occasion.\\n\\nPeople will visit others and spend time with family and friends throughout the day, often exchanging gifts. However this year, many countries have enforced curfews to avoid the spread of the virus.\\n\\nThis year, celebrations are likely to be muted and spent at home, with a lot of places closed or with reduced opening hours.\\n\\nWomen decorate their hands with henna for Eid celebrations (Prakash Mathema/AFP)\\n\\nOne key tradition is for adults to give younger members of the family an “eddeya” or sum of money as a present. Children will excitedly tear open envelopes to spend their money on their Eid festivities.\\n\\nIt is also traditional to visit the sick, give to charity and pay respects to those who died and collect presents for those who have lost loved ones, especially orphans.\\n\\nWith hospital visits restricted, and fears over the spread of the virus, many Muslims will not be able to take part in some of these traditions. Instead, most people will have to resort to celebrating Eid virtually, by calling their friends and family members.\\n\\nHow much money do Muslims give to charity?\\n\\nOne of the key elements of Eid is Zakat al fitr, meaning “charity of breaking the fast\", which must be paid before the end of Ramadan or Eid prayers.\\n\\nThis form of charity is intended so that the less fortunate can also enjoy Eid. It is obligatory upon Muslims, and stems from one of the five pillars of Islam, Zakat, which requires Muslims to give charity to help their communities and to strengthen their spiritual relationship with God.\\n\\nZakat al-fitr is a one-off payment, usually in the form of food or its monetary equivalent to the value of about £7 ($9) which allows the less fortunate to celebrate Eid.\\n\\nSyrian children play at a makeshift playground during celebrations for Eid al-Fitr (Omar Haj Kaddour/AFP)\\n\\nThe donation is intended to absolve the donor from any shortcomings they committed during the holy month and act as a form of thanks to God for allowing observance of the fast.\\n\\nAll Muslims must pay this amount, regardless of age or gender, so long as they possess enough to feed themselves. The head of the family will pay on behalf of any children or dependants.\\n\\nWith the pandemic impacting people and businesses around the world, Muslims have been encouraged to help the less fortunate, particularly in disaster-stricken parts of the world. Towards the end of Ramadan, many charities will run virtual fundraising campaigns to raise money for those in need.\\n\\nWhat do people eat at Eid?\\n\\nAfter a month of fasting everyday, it’s no surprise that Eid largely centres around food. The most decadent and lavish spreads are typically on offer.\\n\\nOne quintessential treat is kahk, a sugar cookie with a shortbread-like texture that can have many different fillings, such as date paste, mixed nuts, agameya (ghee, honey, sesame seeds) and Turkish delight, dusted with icing sugar. It can also be left plain with no filling.\\n\\nBaking kahk is a key social activity in the Middle East, as families gather the night before Eid to cook and decorate while bakeries are inundated with orders. In Egypt, kahk is so beloved that people have renamed the festival Eid al-kahk, meaning “celebration of kahk”.\\n\\nTraditional biscuits are made for Eid in Palestine (Mahmoud Issa/SOPA Images)\\n\\nAnother favourite is qatayef, a fluffy golden brown pancake stuffed with sweet cream and nuts and doused in syrup.\\n\\nFinally there is kunafa, the hallmark dessert of the Middle East, which is eaten copiously. Those more adventurous experiment with this sweet and syrupy dessert, adding different toppings including fruit and nuts to chocolate and cream.\\n\\nUsually, families will spend Eid visiting other relatives and friends, and taking gifts and food over However, with Covid-19 restrictions still in place, many people will spend Eid alone or with immediate family.\\n\\nWhy are there two Eids? What’s the difference?\\n\\nEid al-Fitr, as explained above, comes at the end of Ramadan and celebrates the breaking of the fast.\\n\\nEid al-Adha, which means \"festival of the sacrifice\" is approximately two months after Eid al-Fitr and is culturally considered a bigger event.

              " 'Few topics can stir up powerful emotions more than relations between Israel and Palestine, and the use of language relating to the situation is hotly contested.\\n\\nSince the latest flare-up in the region, many Palestinian activists have taken to social media to criticise the language used by some media outlets and politicians to frame the events in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories.\\n\\nOften, the target of criticism is language that appears to equivocate between unequal sides - particularly the use of terms such as \"clashes\" or references to \"violence\" in the passive tense that do not attribute the cause or target of the violence.\\n\\nAt other times, language used by commentators and media outlets can veer into conspiracy-mongering or dehumanising terms.\\n\\nAn image of a newspaper headline from the New York Times being \"corrected\" by an activist has summed up many of the concerns of some observers. These are some of the terms and concepts which have stoked controversy:\\n\\n1. \\'Clashes\\'\\n\\nOne of the most frequent terms to appear in media reports about the ongoing violence in Jerusalem - and previous events in Israel-Palestine - has been \"clashes\".\\n\\nThe implication of the term is a conflict between two parties. The Oxford English Dictionary describes the verb as to \"come into violent and noisy collision\".\\n\\nMany pro-Palestinian activists, however, have criticised the term for implying a degree of equality in the use of violence and that both sides are equally to blame.\\n\\nAlthough there have been some instances of activists throwing rocks, the Israeli security services are heavily armed and heavily armoured and have been the instigators of virtually all the violence during recent events.\\n\\nThe use of \"clashes\" in the passive sense also removes agency, allowing blame to, implicitly, be spread evenly among those involved.\\n\\nEven ignoring that in many cases there was no reciprocal violence from Palestinian activists, the use of \"clashes\" obscures the nature of the violence taking place and the narrative descends into what has been colloquially referred to as \"bothsideisms\".\\n\\nSimilar points can be made about other terms such as \"unrest\" and \"riots\".\\n\\n2. \\'Conflict\\'\\n\\nIn a similar sense to \"clashes\", the use of the term \"conflict\" can again imply an equivalence of violence between the Palestinians and Israeli security services.\\n\\nAs a whole, the use of the term \"conflict\" has a troubled legacy in the region - for decades, the situation was referred to as the \"Arab-Israeli conflict\".\\n\\nIt\\'s a term still popular among right-wing Israelis, implying as it does that the Arab world as a whole is at war with the small Israeli state, obscuring the plight of the Palestinians in the occupied territories and ignoring the relationships that Israel enjoys with many different Arab states.\\n\\nThe \"Israel-Palestine conflict\", while less obscuring, still implies a degree of equity between the two sides, even if it is also the case that historical violence has been meted out from both parties.\\n\\n3. \\'Property dispute\\'\\n\\nA number of politicians and outlets have referred to the controversy in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood as a \"property dispute\". While in the most literal sense this might be true, it hugely underplays the underlying context, instead implying that what is happening in Sheikh Jarrah is no more significant or morally disreputable than, say, a dispute between a landlord and a tenant in Paris, London or Istanbul.\\n\\nThe planned expulsion of 40 Palestinians from the neighbourhood stems from the fact that the families settled there in 1956, after their expulsion from what is now recognised internationally as Israel. The homes they live in were constructed with the help of the UN Refugee Works Agency (Unrwa) while East Jerusalem was under the control of Jordan.\\n\\nDuring the 1960s, the families agreed a deal with the Jordanian government that would make them the owners of the land and houses. The deal was that they would receive official land deeds, signed in their names, after three years. But the deal was scuppered in 1967, when East Jerusalem was captured by Israel. Israeli law favours settlers by allowing only Jews to claim property they say they owned before 1948 - while denying the same right to Palestinians.\\n\\nSo while there is indeed a \"dispute\" over the property, to discuss it in such terms implies that it is little more than a regular legal issue, rather than a unique situation.\\n\\nUse of the term \"evictions\" also has a similar effect, even if, again, it is accurate in the strictest sense.\\n\\n4. \\'Extremist\\' and \\'terrorist\\'\\n\\nBoth the terms \"terrorist\" and \"extremist\" are often used when talking about Israel-Palestine. Israeli media almost exclusively refers to purported acts of violence from Palestinians as being caused by \"terrorists\". Though the term is perhaps less common in foreign media, it still pops up, particularly among right-wing outlets.\\n\\nWhy the use of the term \"terrorist\" is controversial in journalism is a much larger issue. Agencies such as Reuters have long avoided using it, saying that it violates the news agency\\'s \"value-neutral approach\". In the specific context of events in Jerusalem, it normalises a narrative put out by the Israeli security services.\\n\\nFor most of the world, a terrorist is someone who engages in acts of indiscriminate violence against civilians: the actions of the Islamic State (IS) group and al-Qaeda are particularly prominent in the popular imagination.\\n\\nSuch conflation of Palestinian activists protesting - or, at most, hurling rocks - at Israeli security forces, with the likes of the 9/11 attacks or IS massacres serves to delegitimise the Palestinian cause and imply an irrational thirst for bloodshed.\\n\\n\"Extremist\" is perhaps an even riskier term, for much of the time what constitutes an \"extremist\" is undefined. Many political ideologies are considered extreme because they diverge from what is considered mainstream politics - but the term is ultimately subjective.\\n\\n5. \\'Zionism\\'\\n\\nMany Jewish commentators have regularly expressed discomfort with the use of the term \"Zionism\" or \"Zionist\" when associated with Israeli actions.\\n\\nJerusalem: Biden administration\\'s \\'bothsidesism\\' angers Palestinians Read More »\\n\\nThe term, which originated during the 19th century, refers to the political movement for the establishment of a Jewish homeland. Different incarnations of Zionism have existed, ranging from left-wing advocates for a bi-national, socialist state in historic Palestine, to far-right religious fundamentalists advocating a state based on the Jewish Halakhic laws that exclude non-Jews from citizenship.\\n\\nDuring the past century, however, the term Zionism has also been used by far-right antisemitic groups as part of anti-Jewish conspiracy theories. These have posited that Zionism is not merely a political movement for the colonisation of historic Palestine, but also part of a wider plan for world domination.\\n\\nA popular neo-Nazi myth refers to the \"Zionist Occupation Government\" or ZOG, a term used to describe a secret Jewish cabal that allegedly runs most western governments.\\n\\nA cursory Google of the term \"anti-Zionist\" illustrates the problem: the results include the website of the Jewish anti-Zionist Network, which is a group of left-wing pro-Palestinian Jews, though the results also include the Anti-Zionist League, which is a Neo-Nazi organisation.\\n\\nThis has led many to feel discomfort at the use of the term \"Zionist\", particularly in a context which veers into territory implying control of foreign governments, control of the media or finance, or dual loyalty.\\n\\n6. \\'Islam\\'\\n\\nThe fact that the events in Jerusalem have taken place during Ramadan and have involved worshippers at al-Aqsa Mosque should not obscure the fact that the conflict is not primarily religious. Many Christian Palestinians and secular Palestinians are likewise as invested in the defence of al-Aqsa Mosque and opposing the action against the Sheikh Jarrah residents.\\n\\nThe status of East Jerusalem and al-Aqsa is loaded with religious significance, but it also has huge national resonance for Palestinians of all faiths and political ideologies. The push for the establishment of East Jerusalem as the future capital of a Palestinian state has come as much from secular, Christian and leftist political leaders over the past century as it has from religious Muslims and Islamists.\\n\\nSome media outlets, as well as foreign supporters and opponents of the Palestinian cause, have attempted to frame the situation in Jerusalem as a conflict between Islam and Judaism, between Muslims and Jews. But this is fundamentally inaccurate, and can contribute to both antisemitic and Islamophobic narratives.\\n\\n7. \\'Arab\\'\\n\\nSince the 19th century, theorists, community leaders, politicians and activists have debated the relationship between Palestinian identity and Arab identity. But identity and ethnicity are largely social constructs and are often in a state of flux.\\n\\nAt the height of the Arab nationalist movement from the 1950s to 1970s, many Palestinian political leaders such as Yasser Arafat and George Habash supported the pan-Arabist movement and equated the struggle in Palestine against Israel as part of the wider struggle for Arab unity and independence.\\n\\nHowever, in recent decades, as pan-Arabism has receded and the campaign for Palestinian liberation in and of itself has taken prominence in the region, Palestinians in the diaspora, occupied territories and in Israel\\'s internationally recognised borders have identified first and foremost as \"Palestinian\".\\n\\nThe use of the term \"Arab\" to describe Palestinians is therefore loaded with connotations. This is nowhere more obvious than with Israeli media, especially right-wing outlets, which regularly refer to all Palestinians living between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean as \"Arabs\", implying the falseness of Palestinian identity and the temporality of their connection to the land.\\n\\nIt also implies - ironically somewhat mimicking pan-Arabists - that the Palestinians are simply an extension of the wider Arab world and therefore Israel is the victim by virtue of population and a unified stance against them.\\n\\nDistinction is often made, as well, between Israeli Arabs and Palestinians - that is, those Palestinians who hold Israeli citizenship and those living in the occupied territories. While there are differences in terms of rights and living standards, and while some Palestinians in Israel do proudly boast of their Israeli identity, the majority of Palestinian citizens of Israel identity first and foremost as Palestinian - the largest Palestinian city in Israel, Nazareth, has been erupting in solidarity with the Sheikh Jarrah and al-Aqsa protesters in recent days, for example.\\n\\n8. \\'Temple Mount\\', \\'Haram al-Sharif\\' and \\'al-Aqsa\\'\\n\\nAs mentioned above, the Israel-Palestine situation is not fundamentally religious. But there is one part of Jerusalem where religion plays a major role - the Old City complex which houses al-Aqsa Mosque, the Dome of the Rock and the Western Wall.\\n\\nTo Jews, the complex is known as the Temple Mount - the location of two ancient Biblical temples and the site where the \"divine presence\" is strongest on Earth. The Western Wall, at which Jews pray, is said to be one of the last remaining parts of the Second Temple structure.\\n\\nIn pictures: Israel\\'s forces raid al-Aqsa mosque on Jerusalem Day Read More »\\n\\nTo Muslims, the complex is known as al-Haram al-Sharif (the Noble Sanctuary) and houses al-Aqsa Mosque - one of the three holiest sites in Islam - which includes the Dome of the Rock and other Islamic shrines.\\n\\nMany media outlets try to avoid provocation over what to call the area by referring to it by both its names and elaborating on the distinctions. But even here it is possible to misrepresent the nature of the controversy.\\n\\nSince the capture of East Jerusalem by Israel in 1967, there have been religious Israeli-Jewish campaigners who have called for the construction of the Third Temple on the site - something which they say would herald the coming of the messiah and necessitate the demolition of al-Aqsa Mosque. However, no Israeli leaders have supported this idea publicly, amid fears of a massive backlash from the Muslim world.\\n\\nIn recent decades, though, there have been campaigns by Jewish settler groups for the ban on Jewish prayer on the site to be lifted. The \"status quo\", as it is called, is an agreement between Israel and the Jordanian-linked religious authority that controls the complex. The agreement allows Jews to visit the site, but not pray there. That position has, to this day, also been supported by the Chief Rabbinate of Jerusalem.\\n\\nCampaigners calling for Jewish prayer to be allowed on the complex have framed their argument as one of religious equality - if Muslims are allowed to pray, then why not Jews also?\\n\\nIt is easy to portray this as an issue with Muslim chauvinism, denying Jews access to their holiest site. But to do so ignores the context of the Israeli capture of East Jerusalem and the continued colonisation and settlement of Palestinian land - al-Haram al-Sharif, as arguably the most significant symbol of Palestinian sovereignty, is seen as a red line.\\n\\nIn another world, where there might be a state where Israelis and Palestinians lived as fully equal citizens, then the debate could be considered as one of religious rights and theology - but in the current context, material conditions dictate the narrative.',\n",

The pair married and moved to Tokyo in Japan.\\n\\nShokeir\\'s visit to see her was the first act in a journey that would end up defining his life; a trip that left the then-flight attendant enamoured by the country and its people.\\n\\n“It was fascinating, I fell in love. The people, their attitude, their behaviour, how efficient everything was,\" Shokeir says.\\n\\n\"And there was also a mystery about it all as I didn’t understand the language.”\\n\\nShokeir\\'s sister Azza (far right) led the way for Shokeir (second right) to follow her to Japan and meet his wife Yoko (centre), seen here in 1984 (Credit: Mohamed Shokeir)\\n\\nOn his third visit to the country in 1983, he decided to stay and found a place close to his sister in Fujimidai, in north east Tokyo. He enrolled in a Japanese language course by day and worked for a translation company that produced instruction manuals for Japanese electrical appliances in the afternoons.\\n\\nThat same year, he met his future wife Yoko on a Tokyo train in the evening rush hour.\\n\\n“I had taken the train in the wrong direction, I’d only been in the country a few months and my Japanese then wasn’t that good. I asked the girl who was holding the same handlebar as me how to get to my stop. She told me in good English how to get where I needed to be.”\\n\\nShokeir asked for Yoko’s number as he was impressed by her language skills and keen to make more Japanese friends. \"She didn\\'t have a pen, and nor did I, but a fellow passenger overheard and offered his pen, so I got her number.\" Five years later she became his wife.\\n\\nBig in Japan: From jobless artist to origami king of Gaza Read More »\\n\\nYoko says that while her immediate family did not object to the pairing, some more distant relatives have refused to accept it.\\n\\n\"My husband and I had been in a relationship for a few years before we got married, so my mother, who raised me by herself after my father died in an accident when I was young, and my younger sister did not object to it,\" she says.\\n\\n\"They respected my beliefs. But my two aunts opposed the marriage, and I have not been in contact with them since.\"\\n\\nYoko studied Arabic and Islam before converting to the faith ahead of her marriage in 1988, and made changes to her lifestyle, such as substituting pork with chicken in the fresh steamed gyozas she would make.\\n\\nIn setting up his life in Japan, Shokeir, now 63, became a part of one of the smallest Muslim populations in the world relative to the general population.\\n\\nThe couple celebrate here at Shokeir\\'s graduation in 1991, but Yoko went on to study for a diploma in teaching Japanese from London\\'s Goldsmith University in 1997 (Credit: Mohamed Shokeir)\\n\\nAccording to Professor Emeritus Hirofumi Tanada, a Japanese expert on Islam, there were somewhere between 110,000 to 120,000 Muslims in Japan in 2010, but in a decade that number had roughly doubled to around 230,000.\\n\\nAround 183,000 of these are non-Japanese Muslims, mainly from Indonesia, Pakistan and Bangladesh - Arab Muslims account for around 6,000. The rest, around 46,000, are Japanese Muslims.\\n\\nEven with the dramatic rise in the number of Muslims, they are still a tiny proportion of Japan\\'s total population of more than 126 million people who mainly follow the Shinto faith or Buddhism. Nevertheless, Tanada says his country needs to adapt to its changing demography.\\n\\nWith a declining birth rate, ageing Japanese population and a growing migrant workforce, the slow but steady rise of Muslims in the country could help address some of the issues associated with those trends.\\n\\nMost of Japan’s migrant workforce comes from neighbouring countries, such as China, Vietnam, Cambodia, but their presence has not helped stop the effects of an ageing population.\\n\\nMigration and conversion\\n\\nProfessor Tanada says that while the number of Muslims is increasing, there is no single explanation for the rise.\\n\\n“There’s increased migration. Muslim migrants from these countries came to Japan for work, study and stayed. Conversion has increased because many Muslims married with Japanese people, then [the] Japanese convert at the time of marriage.\"\\n\\nThere are also examples of the opposite, with Japanese people bringing their Muslim partners back to settle in the country.\\n\\nOmneya Al Adeeli, 27, is one such newcomer. She moved to Japan just before the start of the coronavirus pandemic in November 2019, after marrying her Japanese husband Shotaro Ono, who converted at the time of marriage.\\n\\nThey met while he was visiting Nablus in the occupied West Bank, where Al Adeeli owned and ran a small Korean and Japanese eatery called KimPal.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve always been fascinated by Japanese culture, I used to watch anime when I was younger and also learnt my first Japanese words from there, I later took a Japanese culture course at Al Najah University in Nablus.\" Al Adeeli also has a degree in English from Al Quds Open University.\\n\\n“Being aware of Japanese culture is different from living it, but I am keen to embrace and immerse myself more into my life here.”\\n\\nOmneya Al Adeeli is enjoying exploring Japan with her husband Shotaro One (Credit: Omneya Al Adeeli)\\n\\nNow working as an Arabic language writer for a tourism company in Tokyo, Al Adeeli says she is excited about the opportunities her new home country has to offer.\\n\\n\"I love the freedom here, which is missing in Palestine. I can move wherever I want here without checkpoints stopping me. I also love the respect between people, the feeling of equality.\"\\n\\nAccording to Tanada, who authored the book Mosques in Japan: The Communal Activities of Muslims Living in Japan, Japan will see an increase in second- and third-generation Muslims from those who have \"settled down and established a family\" in the country.\\n\\n\"These Muslims are going to be \\'hybrid Muslims\\' that will be exposed to diverse cultural backgrounds. They would be the key people to help bridge the local community with the Muslim community.\"\\n\\nProfessor Hirofumi Tanada worked on research projects in Egypt in the 1990s, above at a barber shop in Cairo (Credit: Hirofumi Tanada)\\n\\nTanada says there are now 110 mosques in the archipelago compared to the 80s, when there were just four.\\n\\nBut the professor cautions against equating growth with integration. He says most Japanese people are unaware of this steady increase, and the communities exist as “parallel societies without interaction\".\\n\\n“There are negative stereotypes of Muslims in Japan, just like there are in Europe. Media covering terrorism by Muslim terrorists and other negative news coverages on Islam created this,” he says.\\n\\n“While it is not easy to change our misconceptions and stereotypes about the Muslim community painted by the media, I hope people could start by taking an interest in them and visit mosques that are open to the general public.”\\n\\nTanada believes Japan must adapt to its changing demography and work towards “multicultural coexistence”, with more interaction needed between the cultures.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne possible case study in that regard is 30-year-old Marliza Madung, who moved to the city of Kobe, west of Osaka, in 2011 after winning a scholarship from the Malaysian government to study Biotechnology at Osaka University.\\n\\nMadung, originally from Sabah in the Malaysian region of Borneo, says she believes coexistence is at the essence of a harmonious society.\\n\\nShe studied the Japanese language in a two-year intensive course before moving to the country. Her interest in Japanese culture has since expanded to include topics as nuanced as the etiquette involved in the giving and receiving business cards, and how to write an email.\\n\\n\"I showed my boss how I can adapt to the Japanese working style by communicating and writing in Japanese, by learning their business manners of extreme politeness and to prove that even with culture differences, I can still learn and adapt well\", she says. \"In return, my boss always gives me time to pray, and lets me have a holiday during the Muslim festival of Eid\".\\n\\nDeveloping relations\\n\\nMadung\\'s adopted hometown of Kobe is also home to Japan\\'s first mosque, built in 1935. Tokyo’s main mosque was built three years later by the Turk-Tatars in 1938 and then redeveloped as Tokyo Camii in 2000.\\n\\nTokyo\\'s main mosque can hold Friday prayers for up to 1,200 worshippers (Credit: CC)\\n\\nWith the fall of the Ottoman Empire, Turks travelled across Asia as travellers and traders to seek a better life, says Shokeir. “Turkish immigrants were the first from the Muslim world to move to Japan. It wasn’t that great economically back then, especially after the Second World War, people struggled.”\\n\\nBut as communities settled and established themselves in the country, mainly running shops and services, or working in the factories, the Muslim community began to grow.\\n\\nShokeir, contributing writer for The Arab, a quarterly digest on Japan-Arab relations, says the relationship between Japan and the Arab world used to be “very superficial” until the oil crises in 1973 and 1979. It was only then that many Japanese people started paying attention to the Middle East.\\n\\nHe states: “Eighty-five percent of its [Japan\\'s] oil is imported from the Gulf countries, so when the Saudis opened the Arabic Islamic Institute in Tokyo, there were a lot of students going there to study Arabic, it was becoming popular. They wanted to know who are these people that we buy our energy from?”\\n\\nOut of the Arab states, Saudi Arabia has the most established relationship with Japan. The Japan Foundation, a cultural exchange programme set up in 1972, started co-sponsoring students in “state of the art” technical colleges in Saudi Arabia, Shokeir, also the Arabic media writer at Qatar’s Georgetown University, tells Middle East Eye from his home in Doha.\\n\\n“The other co-sponsors were the Saudi government and big technical and automotive industries that were rising in Japan, like Panasonic, Sony and Toyota. Graduates from these exceptional colleges would walk straight into engineering careers,” he says.\\n\\nAn ‘ideal’ society\\n\\nDespite first travelling to Japan with no knowledge of its language and knowing little about its culture, four decades later Shokeir is happily married to his Japanese wife and is a fluent speaker of Japanese.\\n\\nShokeir and Yoko have two children, Hamzah and Hanah, seen here on the right (Credit: Mohamed Shokeir)\\n\\nShokeir\\'s language skills - fluency in Arabic and English - and hard work opened doors for him, leading to a job first at the Omani embassy in Tokyo, working as research officer, and then with Japan\\'s main news network NHK where he worked as a news producer. He later joined BBC Arabic in London, and then in 2006 moved to Qatar to join Aljazeera English.\\n\\n\"Japan a meritocratic society and hard work pays off. There is no outward racism there towards Muslims or Arabs, although in Japanese film, the Arab is often shown as ‘the wealthy guy’, as a generous big spender but very superficial with a naive mentality.\"\\n\\nShokeir says that in his experience, “the Japanese are not rude by nature (but) some have their own racist mentality, considering themselves at the top of the pyramid in Asia, like the Brits do in Europe.\\n\\n\"You must remember the Japanese colonised China, Malaysia, the Philippines, they were all once Japanese colonies. But unlike western colonisers, they don’t show racism.\"\\n\\nHalal sushi\\n\\nIn a sign the country is adapting to the growth of Muslim tourism and to its domestic Muslim community, there are now almost 800 halal-friendly restaurants serving dishes that have either halal-certified meat, or are pork and alcohol-free.\\n\\nBut Shokeir recalls the only place halal meat was available in the early 80s was from a Pakistani butchers in Tokyo who would sell a limited supply of meat to the Muslim community.\\n\\n\"There would be others who bought their own livestock and would do their own sacrifices privately, but they would sell this to other Muslims either at the mosque or it could be ordered.\\n\\n\"There were a couple of Arabic restaurants back then, but none of them claimed to be serving halal meat. I stuck mainly to seafood, which was easy to do, and avoided pork products.\"\\n\\nShokeir and a few others knew what the Japanese letters for pork or \"bantu\" were in kanji script and printed this out to circulate amongst the Muslim community, so others could steer away from foods that contained pork, a popular ingredient in Japanese dishes.\\n\\n\"Japan has really come a long way, and developed and adapted to the communities living there. It makes me reconsider returning there for retirement.\"\\n\\nMarliza Madung says there are more facilities for Muslims now than there were ten years ago (Credit: Marliza Madung)\\n\\nMadung agrees. She\\'s noticed the rapid growth in catering to Muslim needs in the last decade that she\\'s been living in the country.\\n\\n\"The Japanese government and even the private sector have made a lot of effort to accommodate Muslims in Japan.

              " 'Since the early days of Islam, the adhan has been chanted to call Muslim worshippers to each of the five daily prayers. It is timed meticulously, in accordance with the sun’s position in the sky from first light until nightfall, beginning with the dawn prayer – or fajr – and ending with the evening prayer, isha.\\n\\nLiterally meaning \"to inform\" or \"to announce\", the adhan is usually broadcast from the minarets of mosques across the Muslim world for congregational prayers, but is also recited by individual worshippers performing the obligatory prayers wherever they happen to be. In Muslim communities, the adhan is gently recited in the right ear of a newborn baby, as a welcome to the world.\\n\\nImam Ali Tos gave his first adhan when he was a child in Konya, Turkey (Tom Gowanlock/Cambridge Central Mosque)\\n\\nThe beauty of the call lies in its melody, which can have the power to captivate the ears of Muslims and non-Muslims alike.\\n\\nTraditionally, the muezzin – the person who recited the adhan – would be chosen from among the community solely for his strong and beautiful voice, says Imam Hafiz Ali Tos from the Cambridge Central Mosque in England.\\n\\n“The muezzin […] would climb to the top of the tower to call the faithful to the mosques for collective or jamaa prayer,” he adds.\\n\\nImam Ali says he gave his first adhan when he was just five years old, to a room full of family elders in his home city of Konya, in south-central Turkey. Growing up surrounded by the many minarets of mosques built under the Seljuk Turks, Imam Ali couldn’t help but be inspired by the “enchanting” sound of the call.\\n\\n“My family complimented my voice and encouraged me to say the adhan, and I’d get a gift for saying it clearly. Myself and other local boys would then compete to see who could recite it the best.”\\n\\nAlthough a euphonious voice is a must, historically muezzins needed additional qualifications – to be well versed in tajweed, the rules of pronunciation, and be punctual time-keepers able to accurately determine the time of day, says Shaykh Ahmed Saad, director of the Ihsan Institute, a UK-based centre for studying Islam. They would also need to be fit enough to climb (and descend) a long spiral staircase to the top of a minaret five times a day.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It would be easier to train for the army,” he jokes.\\n\\nThe early years\\n\\nThe standard words that make up the adhan came a few years after the arrival of Islam.\\n\\nEarly Muslims in 7th-century Arabia were small in number and would let one another know it was time to pray by word of mouth. But as their numbers grew, Prophet Muhammad and his companions would often discuss the best way to gather the community for prayer.\\n\\nA horn, similar to the Jewish shofar, was considered, as were bells like those used by Christians to call people to church service.\\n\\nA muezzin makes the call to prayer at the Jame Masjid in Kathmandu, Nepal (AFP)\\n\\nOne hadith (reported sayings and traditions of the prophet) states that a companion of the prophet, Abdullah Ibn Zayd, had a dream telling him to use the human voice to make the call to prayer, and that he was also told the words to be recited.\\n\\nBilal ibn Rabah al-Habashi, a freed Abyssinian slave and early convert to Islam, was chosen to give the call to prayer because of his beautiful voice. The same words from that 7th-century dream are still recited today, with some phrases repeated:\\n\\nGod is Great, God is Great (Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar)\\n\\nI bear witness that there is no god except the One God\\n\\nI bear witness that Muhammad is the messenger of God\\n\\nHurry to the prayer, Hurry to success\\n\\nGod is great, God is great\\n\\nThere is no god except the One God\\n\\nChanges to the prayer call\\n\\nThe adhan is recited in Arabic and can be heard across skylines in parts of Nigeria, Malaysia and even Europe. The East London Mosque in the UK, and several mosques in the Netherlands, play the adhan publicly several times a day.\\n\\nIn 1923, following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and under the presidency of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the adhan was given in Turkish as the country went through a period of nationalism. It wasn’t until 1950, when Adnan Menderes came to power, that the traditional Arabic adhan was reintroduced to Turkey. It has remained in place since.\\n\\nUntil recently, 4,000 mosques in Cairo would broadcast the adhan moments after one another (AFP)\\n\\nSunni and Shia Muslims also have slight variations, with the latter including the words: \"I bear witness that Ali is the friend of Allah\" in reference to Ali ibn Ali Talib, the prophet\\'s cousin and later a venerated figure.\\n\\nThere was also a temporary change to the words recited in the adhan following the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. In Kuwait, the words \"come to prayer\" were replaced with \"pray in your homes\" in the call, to deter people from praying communally at mosques.\\n\\n\\'Each [Egyptian] governorate used to hold auditions and applicants would have to go through tests and exams\\' - Shaykh Ahmed Saad, director of the Ihsan Institute\\n\\nThough typically melodious, in some densely populated Muslim-majority cities the simultaneous announcements can become discordant.\\n\\nThe Egyptian government began implementing the Tawheed Al Adhan, or Adhan Unification Project, in 2010 to remove the multitude of adhans heard in Cairo - where there are an estimated 4,000 official mosques and 30,000 “unofficial mosques” - and play out one standardised adhan over state radio.\\n\\nThis was the start of the decline of the muezineen (plural for muezzin) in Egypt, says Shaykh Saad of his native country: “Each governorate used to hold auditions and applicants would have to go through tests and exams to make sure they were suitable for the job,” he said.\\n\\nHe adds that, with the unification project, this no longer happens; instead, each of Egypt’s 29 governorates has one muezzin appointed who makes the call from a mosque, and this adhan is then broadcast live across the local area.\\n\\nThis “erosion of tradition” saddens Shaykh Saad: “I feel like the creativity of the adhan melodies is being lost… the landscape of the adhan now feels barren.”\\n\\nMuezzins at the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus use the unique, collective Al-Jawq technique (AFP)\\n\\nOne place where giving the call to prayer is still an art is the ancient city of Damascus.\\n\\nIn the eighth-century Great Umayyad mosque in Damascus, six muezzins collectively recite the adhan in front of a loudspeaker that plays out across the ancient city from three of the mosque\\'s minarets.\\n\\nThis group recitation of the adhan is known as Al-Jawq, and it’s unique to Syria, originating 500 years ago as a way to inform pilgrims destined for Mecca that it was time for prayer. The six are part of a select group of 25 muezzins who take turns to recite collectively in a style particular to the mosque.\\n\\nThe art of the adhan\\n\\nAlthough the words remain consistent, careful listeners to the call will be able to pick up subtle differences in the rhythm and tone of the words.\\n\\n“The art of the adhan was developed during the Ottoman Empire, and was a creative way for listeners to be able to tell the time of prayer just by hearing the tone of the adhan,” said Shaykh Saad.\\n\\n“Remember, there were no watches back then, and someone may be busy at work, on their farm, or blind and unable to see the time of day, but just by hearing the tone of the adhan they would know which prayer it was.”\\n\\nThe muezzin of the Katindo mosque in Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo (AFP)\\n\\nBased on variations of the Middle Eastern maqam melodic system, incorporating scales, phrases and harmonies to create a “mood” in both classical music as well as Quran recitation, the prayer call can evoke myriad emotions. For example, an adhan recited in the Nahawand maqam – named after the Nahavand province in Iran, where it originated – is melancholic and often used for the mid-afternoon asr prayer on a Thursday, Imam Ali says, to mark the onset of Friday, a holy day in Islam.\\n\\nShaykh Saad says that maqam Bayati is the classic adhan style. Described as a “relaxing adhan with warm, deep tones”, it is often used for the midday prayer, or dhuhr.\\n\\n“Dhuhr is the mother of prayers and Bayati the mother of maqams,” says Saad. “The midday prayer was the first to be established by early Muslims.”\\n\\nAlthough there has been no standardisation as to which maqam should be used for which prayer adhan, it became “ritualistic and people organised among themselves over time, with certain ones more commonly used for certain prayers, but they are not necessarily always used”, explains Shaykh Saad.\\n\\nMaqam Sabah’s slow and steady rhythm is commonly heard at dawn, for the fajr prayer to gently lull worshippers into the mosque, but the quick beat of maqam Segah is often associated with the sunset prayer, or maghrib, when time can be limited.\\n\\n\"Maghrib time is also the time Muslims break their fast (during Ramadan and additional fasts outside of the holy month). They will not want a long adhan at this time,\" Imam Ali says. \"Also, in the month of Ramadan after the fast is broken, people have to get ready for the additional evening prayers of tarawih. So this adhan and prayer are kept short.\"\\n\\nShaykh Ahmed Saad says it can take over a year to train a muezzin (Ahmed Saad)\\n\\nIn Tunisia, trainee muezzins go to the Rachidi Institute of Tunisian Music to fine-tune their maqam style and adhan performance.\\n\\n“It can take between six months to more than a year for a muezzin to be fully trained, it all depends on how quickly they can pick up the subtleties in style, how good their ears are, and their aptitude,” says Shaykh Saad.\\n\\nA student learning how to recite the Quran may choose a particular maqam to recite in, and with time and expertise will likely develop their own style, and dip in and out of different maqams to reflect the mood of the passage being recited.\\n\\n“If you are reading a passage about day and night, heaven and hell, you would use [maqam] Segah, as it goes up and down… like a wave, it contrasts emotions,” says Shaykh Saad.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe steady rhythm of the Egyptian Sheikh Mohammad Rifat’s maghrib adhan still has the power to move Shaykh Saad.\\n\\nAs a child in the 1990s, he listened to the late sheikh at his parents’ home in the governorate of Monufia, in northern Egypt; and it’s this same adhan that is still played every year on the country’s national radio at maghrib time in Ramadan.\\n\\n“[Sheikh Mohammad Rifat] epitomises the holy month, he is Ramadan and Ramadan is him, the two are eternally bound,” says Shaykh Saad.\\n\\nBorn in 1882, and popular for his melodious voice, Sheikh Rifat was the first person to recite the Quran in Arabic on BBC Radio, in 1935. He died in 1950, yet his “legacy lives on”, says Shaykh Saad.\\n\\n“No wonder he was known as the Voice of Heaven – all these years later it still feels like his adhan is coming to us from somewhere heavenly.”\\n\\nThis article is available in French on Middle East Eye French edition.',\n",

The managers and owners never said \\'no\\' outright but instead dragged their feet and kept me waiting for weeks, if not months until I would give up and try elsewhere.”\\n\\nBut Beygi’s persistence paid off. After months of trying, one garage owner decided to give her a shot.\\n\\nA mechanical engineer by training, the man taught his new apprentice not only the practical aspects of fixing an off-road vehicle but also gave her a theoretical understanding of what made an engine work and a vehicle move.\\n\\nUntil that moment she was on the brink of giving up and moving to Germany to start a new life.\\n\\nBeygi\\'s father had also trained as a mechanic (Courtesy: Amir Kholousi)\\n\\nAt home, Beygi was fortunate to have the full support of a loved one as she pursued her dream of becoming a mechanic.\\n\\nAlthough her mother was sceptical of her career choice, her father who had studied as a mechanic himself gave her encouragement.\\n\\n“He even gave me his books and notes from his school years,” she says.\\n\\nToday Beygi has an established reputation as a reliable mechanic specialising in 4x4s with customers coming in from far and wide for repairs and servicing to their vehicles. Her Instagram page is also filled with messages from well-wishers and customers.\\n\\nOne message reads: “She is friendly, skillful, honest, and fair - what more can someone ask from a mechanic?”\\n\\nAnother satisfied customer says: “My car had engine problems and repeated attempts to fix it had failed. (Beygi) correctly diagnosed the problem in ten seconds.”\\n\\nSuch support stems from more than just respect for Beygi’s skills. She is also known for her pioneering role in creating a space for women in an industry almost entirely dominated by men.\\n\\nBeygi runs workshops teaching other women the basics of car maintenance (Courtesy: Sahar Beygi)\\n\\nShe plans to break that hold by opening up an all-female garage to create jobs and “provide a safe working environment for women”.\\n\\n\\'I am pleased that I’ve been able to set the ground work for future generations to follow in my footsteps. I’m proud of that\\' - Sahar Beygi\\n\\n“I am pleased that I’ve been able to set the ground work for future generations to follow in my footsteps. I’m proud of that,” Beygi says, adding: “On my journey, I’ve endured many hardships. But I have no qualms or complaints.”\\n\\nReflecting back on that initial breakdown in 2014, Beygi, now a keen off-road driver says she shudders at the thought of getting stranded out in the country.\\n\\n“Just imagine if it had happened off the road,” she says.\\n\\nPassion and love\\n\\nTo say there is a trend in Iran towards women becoming mechanics may be an exaggeration. But Beygi is certainly not the only woman making a career out of a love of cars.\\n\\nSadaf Ataei, who like Beygi is also 34, runs a successful Instagram page where she posts videos and images of herself repairing cars and sharing tips on maintenance and basic upkeep.\\n\\nGoing by the nickname “Ata Mechanic”, she works three days at an upscale garage in Northern Tehran, which services foreign brands like Mercedes Benz and Toyota, among others.\\n\\nThe rest of the week she spends at a cluttered and oil-stained garage in the Tehransar neighbourhood, an area home to Iranian car manufacturing plants.\\n\\nAtaei says her career is not without its pitfalls, such as having to face harassment from some men (Courtesy: Sadaf Ataei)\\n\\nAtaei decided to become a mechanic two years ago after a conversation with a career advisor. Her interest in cars had its roots in childhood memories of helping her father as he made repairs.\\n\\n“Another woman in my place might have regretted the decision and quit early on,” Ataei said. “It is only passion and love that can drive you forward.\"\\n\\nAnd it’s the strength of her passion that keeps her in the career today, despite its many pitfalls for women.\\n\\nIran allows women weightlifters to compete internationally Read More »\\n\\nAs well as the everyday realities of being a mechanic, such as having to work in bitter cold or sweltering heat depending on the time of year, she also has to put up with harassment from some of the men she encounters, both in the real world and on social media.\\n\\nIn a podcast interview in 2020, Ataei says: “It is really painful to see some people who are unable to understand women and try to undermine my work.\\n\\n“They take what I do for granted and describe it as of no significance… sometimes it is also very difficult to deal with people who bring their cars for repairs but they don’t even know how to speak properly and with respect.”\\n\\nTenacity\\n\\nThe single strand that unites Beygi and Ataei’s experiences, as well as others like them, is their intense curiosity.\\n\\nNiloofar Farahmand never wanted to rely on a male relative to take care of her car for her.\\n\\n\"I always took my car to the repair shop myself and wanted to learn as much as possible about how it works,\" she says, describing how she would approach mechanics and ask them to explain what they were doing.\\n\\n“Yet on so many occasions, I got ridiculed or had sarcastic responses without them answering my questions.”\\n\\nNiloofar Farahmand (left) and Kiana Yarahmadi say a career as a mechanic is as accessible as ever for women in Iran (Mohammad Esmaeilizadeh/MEE)\\n\\nBut not all male mechanics had this attitude and one gave her a chance to learn that changed her life two summers ago. Her father, knowing about his daughter’s interests, asked their family mechanic to let his daughter into his workshop to learn the basics of car maintenance. To their surprise, the man agreed.\\n\\n\"By nature, I am a curious girl but I had no intention of becoming a mechanic,” Farahmand says, recalling her reaction. “I just wanted answers to my questions about how a car engine worked and how to fix my car.\"\\n\\n\\'In this field women should be very resilient.

I laughed at those who ridiculed us. Someone else might have burst into tears.\\n\\nThe pair say they have no regrets about their career choice despite its physically demanding nature (Mohammad Esmaeilizadeh/MEE)\\n\\n“But I always laughed in the face of problems. Now the same people who made fun of us and tried to undermine our efforts praise our perseverance.\"\\n\\nThe pair continued to build up their knowledge of the trade through vocational and theoretical courses on car maintenance.\\n\\nAfter building up a loyal customer base at the garage, the pair recently moved to a new repair shop in northern Tehran.\\n\\nThey believe that despite the rarity of female mechanics in Iran, the situation for others who want to enter the career has never been better.\\n\\n\"The union of automobile mechanics recognises women and supports them,” says Yarahmadi.\\n\\n“Women can take part in vocational training courses much more easily than before.”\\n\\n\\'Every Iran is different\\': The female photographers seeing their country with fresh eyes Read More »\\n\\nToday the two, both popular figures on Instagram with a following in the tens of thousands, receive calls and messages from other young women asking them for advice on how to enter the industry. There’s also interest from repair shops looking for female apprentices to take on board.\\n\\n\"I believe women work with more discipline and concentration,” Farahmand says.\\n\\n“They not only keep the workplace clean and tidy but their presence also makes other employees act and behave more decently.”\\n\\nFarahmand and Yarahmadi, both in their 30s, say almost all their friends and relatives bring their cars to them for maintenance and repair, and that they are the first port of call when it comes to any car-related question.\\n\\nWhile for others, being so in demand might be a cause of frustration, that is not the case for Farahmand and Yarahmadi.\\n\\n\"Physically I may become tired of this job but I will never doubt choosing this field as my career,\" Yarahmadi says.\\n\\n\"On the contrary when people put such great responsibility on my shoulders and trust me with their cars, I realise that I am on the right path.\"',\n",
              " \"Much as Kafka’s young Gregor Samsa woke one morning to find he was an insect, Aziz Mohammed’s young narrator wakes to find his nose is bleeding, a first sign of his leukaemia. The Critical Case of a Man Called K, the Saudi author’s first novel, is in some ways a re-telling of Kafka’s The Metamorphosis, through the lens of the changes happening to a critically ill body.\\n\\nThe novel takes the form of a 40-week journal, written first on the narrator’s work laptop, then at home and in the hospital. The unnamed narrator borrows his moniker “K” from Kafka’s The Castle and quotes extensively from Kafka’s Diaries. Like the Diaries, this is a first-person account. But The Metamorphosis is also central, and K might as well have turned into a giant bug. His family treats his new body, transformed by leukaemia, as no less terrifying and unwelcome than a human-sized cockroach.\\n\\nBefore publishing The Critical Case of a Man Called K in the original Arabic in 2017, Mohammed had published only one short story, and that was under a pseudonym. But the novel found a passionate fandom even before it was shortlisted for the 2018 International Prize for Arabic Fiction (IPAF). Slowly, it is appearing in other languages. It came out in Simon Corthay’s French translation in January, Humphrey Davies’s English translation this month, and is forthcoming in Chinese.\\n\\nIt is not only Kafka that shapes the protagonist’s story. Later in the book, the narrator professes an affection for Jeff Kinney’s Diary of a Wimpy Kid, and his tone throughout the book reflects that series’ cynical, boyish sarcasm. This comes through at just the right pitch in Davies’s translation, which is as unassuming as it is tightly paced.\\n\\nThe narrative rushes from week to week with a barely suppressed hysteria as leukaemia rapidly transforms K’s body and relationships, as though we were tumbling down a rabbit hole of illness and screaming silently to ourselves the whole way.\\n\\nA patchwork of stories\\n\\nMohammed’s debut is not only about illness, but also about the ways in which we make ourselves out of stories. In the opening chapters, K has to attend a meeting focused on corporate success stories, and some of his co-workers model their self-image on this genre. K, on the other hand, models his after foreign novels. He begins writing his story on a computer at work, where he is in the IT department in an unnamed city. He writes: “Let’s call it the Eastern Petrochemicals Company, after the Eastern Petroleum Company where one of [Jun'ichiro] Tanizaki’s protagonists works.”\\n\\nIn flashbacks to K’s childhood, we learn that he has never been entirely healthy. His boyhood trips to the doctor resulted in mockery from the medic and scorn from his father. His father frequently told him, in response to health complaints, “Don’t exaggerate!” Thus, he forces himself not to see what’s going on in his body until he collapses. When he is taken to the hospital, blood tests show something is very wrong.\\n\\nAll of these minor characters seem to be hurtling towards some terrible future, such that even the inanimate objects are filled with dread\\n\\nThe doctor directs K to the capital for further testing. He takes an excruciating train journey, every moment of which is dense with his alienation and dread. He watches a woman who is travelling with her children and an anxious foreign maid, and an elderly African couple, where the husband is ill.\\n\\nAll of these minor characters seem to be hurtling towards some terrible future, such that even the inanimate objects are filled with dread. The elderly couple’s “suitcases also seemed to be trying to hang on, though with great effort, so that it seemed that at any moment they might fall apart, scattering their contents”.\\n\\nFittingly, K begins Thomas Mann’s Magic Mountain on the train journey, although he never finishes this classic novel about illness and death. That unfinished novel hangs over the narrative like a thread halfway unspooled, a treatment not completed.\\n\\nLater, the company’s insipid “success stories” are echoed by the equally insipid “cancer-survivor stories” with which K is deluged. As K writes, “It would have been insensitive of anybody to come and tell me tales of patients who’d lost the battle and died horrible deaths, but it would have been more entertaining.”\\n\\nThe social demands of illness\\n\\nLike the Samsa family in The Metamorphosis, K’s family goes through periods of being angry, disappointed, afraid, and ashamed of his illness. K’s older sister is the most powerful among them, the one most interested in burnishing the family’s reputation. The echo of her high heels clicking through the family home is one of the book’s most terrifying sounds. She has already married into a more powerful family, and she is determined to make a good match for K’s brother.\\n\\nAziz Mohamed's debut novel was shortlisted for the International Prize for Arabic Fiction in 2018 (Hoopoe Press/AUC Press)\\n\\nThis match, she has decided, must not be derailed by K’s illness. As K drolly reflects, “It was miraculous enough that those people had agreed to marry their daughter to my hardworking brother and his unconnected family, and any mistake from our side might cause a rift that could never be mended.”\\n\\nK’s social obligations create the most painful moments in the book. Now that he’s ill, the family insists even more vigorously that he participate in family functions. And although K wants to stop caring, he is always drawn back in. He avoids the contract-signing for his brother’s wedding, but he gives in to pressure to visit the bride’s family.\\n\\nHere as elsewhere, K is keenly attentive to the menace of the objects around him. In the bride’s family home, “Most conspicuous were the ancient swords and rifles they had hung on the walls, to proclaim that riches hadn’t caused them to forget their heritage and their forefathers’ way of life, as though, despite all the conspicuous wealth, they’d prefer to live warring with a neighbouring tribe over a water well.”\\n\\nThe group sits down to an enormous meal. K is suffering from such acute nausea he can’t bear food, but, after much nudging, he gives in and eats. Later, he vomits so violently that he passes out, and the bride’s family must break down their own bathroom door. They continue to harangue K by visiting him in the hospital, proud and proprietary after they’ve “rescued” him from death. The reader can only grit their teeth as these men sit around his hospital room, talking to each other when K remains stubbornly sunk in silence.\\n\\nThe men of the bride’s family, like nearly all the book’s characters, are caricatures. It is rare for a person in the book to be given dimension, and the only figures K can really connect to are other patients in the hospital. And, soon after we come to care about them, they die.\\n\\nBetter off dead\\n\\nMuch as Gregor’s family wants him to leave in The Metamorphosis, K’s family also says, in their most heated arguments, that K should hurry up and die. Some, like K’s mother, are concerned about his physical suffering. K’s sister, on the other hand, “begged me to die quickly and rid them of all the trouble I was causing”.\\n\\nThe novel is a fast and enjoyable read, grounded in the capitalist nightmare of 21st century healthcare\\n\\nK’s death hangs over the novel, seeming to grow closer and closer as we speed toward the final pages. But The Critical Case of K does not end like The Metamorphosis. Neither does it give in to the tropes of “survival” or “success”. K reaches the final stage of his personal metamorphosis at 40 weeks, much like a baby’s gestation, and the change that happens is unexpected.\\n\\nWe never find out what happens after the 40th week, or how this memoir has reached our hands. Perhaps a figure like Kafka’s friend Max Brod rescued the pages from deletion, or perhaps the narrator himself decided to overcome his fears and publish them.\\n\\nRegardless, the novel is a fast and enjoyable read, managing to thread a narrative needle between the sardonic youthfulness of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid stories and the dispassionate alienation of The Metamorphosis, all while keeping it grounded in the capitalist nightmare of 21st-century healthcare.\\n\\nIn a 2018 interview with IPAF organisers, Aziz Mohammed suggested that his next novel might be connected to this one, adding, “The temptation to go further with something I thought I was done with is usually what motivates me to continue.”\\n\\nWe can only wait impatiently for whatever is to come next.\\n\\nThe Critical Case of a Man Called K is available from Hoopoe Press, translated by Humphrey Davies\",\n",

They're usually cooked with a combination of different vegetables or meat and are spiced accordingly to the taste of each country. Decades of trade with East Africa influenced Gulf flavours by adding spices like cloves and whole dried limes into their cuisine, whereas Iraq and the Levant (Syria, Jordan, Palestine and Lebanon) take inspiration from the Indian subcontinent, using spices such as turmeric and cumin.\\n\\nThe split red lentils used for this recipe (@middleeats)\\n\\nIt’s mostly served during Ramadan as an appetiser and to prepare the stomach for a large meal after a day of fasting, but it’s also a favourite in winter due to its warming, nourishing flavours and satisfying texture.

              " 'From Spain\\'s Alhambra, to Bosnia\\'s Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque and Iran\\'s Hasht Behesht Palace, the interior domes of many of the striking mosques and palaces across the Middle East and beyond feature a \"honeycomb-like vaulting\": this exclusive design has a name of its own – muqarnas.\\n\\nThis centuries-old style of architectural grandeur may adorn a building for purely aesthetic reasons, creating a smooth decorative zone that transitions between the bare walls and the ceiling of a building. But it can also serve a purpose in structural design - as load-bearing formations - with the earliest examples found in Mesopotamia.\\n\\nHistorically, muqarnas grew in their decorative use some time in the 12th century, during Islam\\'s golden age, when Muslims made significant advancements in architecture, mathematics, science and the arts.\\n\\nThe concave structures are not sanctioned just for domes. They can also be found beautifying half-dome entrances as well as iwans - a rectangular space that serves as an entrance into a mosque from the courtyard - and the mihrab, a niche in the wall of a mosque that indicates the direction of prayer for Muslims.\\n\\nHasht Behesht Palace, in Isfahan, Iran was built in the 17th century by Suleiman I, the eighth Shah of the Safavid Empire (Zirrar Ali)\\n\\nStructural differences\\n\\nThere are two distinct forms of design: the North African-Middle Eastern and the Persian, where muqarnas are known as ahoopay. Within these forms, there are many styles based on different shapes such as squares, triangles, or assemblies of surface-decorated panels resembling pole table patterns.\\n\\nThe origin is still debated, but most sources say muqarnas are an evolution of the squinch - a rounding of corners in the upper angles of a square room allowing for the creation of a dome. The earliest example can be found in ancient Persia under the Sasanian Empire (224 to 651 AD).\\n\\nThe first forms of recognisable muqarnas were found in 10th-century architecture near the northeastern Iranian city of Nishapur, and also in Samarkand, in modern-day Uzbekistan.\\n\\nAs trade routes developed and as Islam flourished, so did the spreading of ideas - including architectural ones. Muqarnas can now be found in many notable historical and some modern buildings.\\n\\nThey can either be carved into the structure of a wall and ceiling, or they can be added on and hung purely as a decorative surface. This is often difficult for the untrained eye to differentiate.\\n\\nMuqarnas differ based on the location + Show - Hide Murqarnas can be made of brick, stone, stucco, or wood, and are sometimes clad with tiles or plaster. The size, shape, composition and use depend greatly on the region they are found: Muqarnas found in the West are often more intricate and creative as they developed in a time when regulation was less rigorous. They are often made of stucco due to an abundance of natural clay in the region.\\n\\nIn Syria and Turkey, muqarnas developed under stricter rules and are also mainly constructed out of marble and stone, so they tend to be larger and less intricate.\\n\\nStone is popular in Egypt, as hot weather and harsh desert winds can greatly wear down weaker materials like stucco.\\n\\nIn other parts of North Africa, and in Iran, Iraq and Pakistan, muqarnas are built with bricks or covered in plaster and colourfully painted with ornate patterns.\\n\\nThe most distinctive form of muqarnas is the honeycomb structure, which can either seem impossibly intricate or seemingly simple - both results of a skillful combination of mathematics and art.\\n\\nMiddle East Eye has collated images of some of these intricate structures from ancient and modern architecture.\\n\\nAlhambra Palace\\n\\nThe palace and fortress of Alhambra were constructed using wood, allowing the artist and architect to incorporate Arabesque patterns and Quranic verses (Zirraar Ali)\\n\\nLocation: Granada, Spain\\n\\nDate completed: Mid-13th century (Nasrid dynasty era), but renovated several times since\\n\\nDescribed by Moorish poets as “pearls set in emeralds”, the Alhambra was the royal palace of various Muslim dynasties in Islamic Spain that was set on top of a hill surrounded by forests.\\n\\nThe palace and fortress are decorated throughout with geometrical patterns in an Arabesque setting with fine detailed muqarnas incorporating Quranic verses and names of sultans. Interestingly, pseudo-Arabic - an unintelligible Arabic script made to mimic Arabic text - was also added as decoration to parts of the palace during its many renovations.\\n\\nGateway into Old Cairo\\n\\n‘Cairo style’ muqarnas made out of stone are known not only for their unique style but also because they are strong and able to connect structures around them (Zirrar Ali)\\n\\nLocation: Cairo, Egypt\\n\\nDate completed: 12th century (Bahri Mamluk era)\\n\\nOld Cairo was once a walled city with many entrances and exit points, with smaller gateways and doors separating quarters between areas. The stone muqarnas seen above doorways have come to be known as \"Cairo style\" and are a prominent design feature in most post-Fatimid work, especially those employed by the Mamluks, a dynasty led by slaves who converted to Islam and became kings in the 12th century.\\n\\nUnlike their elegant and finer Persian counterparts, the Cairo style muqarnas are much larger, usually built out of stone, and are concentrated in a limited space. They easily interconnect into the walls around them, which allows for a stronger structure in this earthquake-prone region of the world.\\n\\nAl-Rifa’i Mosque\\n\\nThe Al-Rifa’i Mosque in Cairo features design features that were typically seen in Ottoman architecture (Zirrar Ali)\\n\\nLocation: Cairo, Egypt\\n\\nDate completed: 1912 (Ottoman era)\\n\\nThe Al-Rifa\\'i Mosque is a modern structure that was built in 1912 and stands next to the historical Mosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan. The resemblance of both mosques in style and grandeur was an attempt by the rulers of Egypt at the time to associate themselves with the glory of the Mamluk dynasty.\\n\\nIt is also worth noting, though not easily visible, that the muqarnas have stalactites - hanging rounded ornaments - a design feature usually seen in Ottoman architecture, but also present in Egypt as a remnant of the 300-year Ottoman rule.\\n\\nJomhoori Eslami, Shrine of Imam Reza\\n\\nThe muqarnas of the Jomhoori Eslami are a rare representation of traditional tile-cutting techniques (Zirrar Ali)\\n\\nLocation: Mashhad, Iran\\n\\nDate completed: 821 (Tahirid era)\\n\\nThe Jomhoori Eslami represents two distinctive features of Persian design – muqarnas and rasmi-bandi.\\n\\nOne part of the iwan (rectangular hall or space) features muqarnas, with the rest composed of rasmi-bandi, structures similar to spoke-wheel roofs. These forms demonstrate the geometry skills needed to be able to fill in space.\\n\\nIt is highly unusual, if not near impossible, to find traditional tile-cutting techniques used in the construction of modern-day muqarnas in Iran. Most are computer designed and laser cut to achieve the perfect fit, but they continue to impress visitors and worshippers, as Persian architecture has evolved but not departed from the genius of mosque design.\\n\\nGoharshad Mosque\\n\\nThe Goharshad Mosque is part of a larger complex of the Imam Reza shrine where congregational prayers are led (Zirrar Ali)\\n\\nLocation: Mashhad, Iran\\n\\nDate completed: 1418 (Timurid dynasty era)\\n\\nInfluenced by Samarkand architecture, many parts of the mosque itself were rebuilt between the 1950s and 1970s.\\n\\nThe muqarnas behind and above the central mihrab are incredibly complex. They are not mirrored and gradually become smaller as they get closer to the ceiling. Made of plaster, they are painted with floral designs in navy blue, gold, and turquoise. Given the restorative work, it is highly unlikely these muqarnas are original Timurid.\\n\\nToday the mosque is part of the larger complex of the Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad and serves as one of the central places where congregational prayers are led.\\n\\nHasht Behesht Palace\\n\\nHasht Behesht literally translates to the palace of the \"eight heavens\" (Zirrar Ali)\\n\\nLocation: Isfahan, Iran\\n\\nDate completed: 1669 (Safavid era)\\n\\nBuilt in the 17th century, this private pavilion was built by Suleiman I, the eighth Shah of the Safavid Empire. The Safavid’s were renowned for their patronage to the arts and the development of a rich architectural style that today is considered to be the best example of Persian and Islamic art.\\n\\nUnlike most Persian architecture where muqarnas are found at the entrance of a building, here they take a \"pole table\" style to fill the empty space below the dome. The wide flat base of the outer muqarnas are decorated with floral and Arabesque patterns, a reference and repeated theme in Persian art alluding to the highest heavens.\\n\\nGazi Husrev-beg Mosque\\n\\nThe Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque is said to be the most representative of the Ottomans in all of the Balkans (Zirrar Ali)\\n\\nLocation: Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina\\n\\nDate completed: 1530 (Ottoman era)\\n\\nBuilt and designed in the 16th century by Adzem Esir Ali, a Persian from Tabriz who was the chief architect during the Ottoman Empire. The Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque is the largest mosque in Bosnia and Herzegovina and is seen as the most important piece of architecture from Ottoman rule in the Balkans.\\n\\nThe main entrance is decked with muqarnas that resemble a style that has come to be known as the \"Sinan style\", after the Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan (1490-1588).\\n\\n\\n\\nThe mosque was damaged during the Siege of Sarajevo in 1996, but reconstruction work started immediately after the war ended, signifying the importance of this centre for prayer.\\n\\nBadshahi Mosque\\n\\nThe Badshahi Mosque is built out of red sandstone with white marble inlays and features floral frescos (Zirrar Ali)\\n\\nLocation: Lahore, Pakistan\\n\\nDate completed: 1671 (Mughal era)\\n\\nThe Badshahi Mosque, or \"Imperial Mosque\", is a Mughal era structure in Lahore, the capital of Pakistan’s Punjab province. Built by Emperor Aurangzeb in 1671, it is said to be the most iconic mosque in the country.\\n\\nLahore was once a gateway to Persia and began to embody the region\\'s distinct style in its own architecture. The Badshahi Mosque is built from red sandstone with white marble inlays and also features \"pole table\" style muqarnas that are almost identical to the ones found in mosques and traditional houses in Kashan.\\n\\nAlthough none of the mosque\\'s original artwork has survived, recent restorations in 2008 imported red stone from the Indian state of Rajasthan, the original Mughal source of this colourful material.\\n\\nWazir Khan Mosque\\n\\nWazir Khan Mosque in Lahore, Pakistan (Zirrar Ali)\\n\\nLocation: Lahore, Pakistan\\n\\nDate completed: 1641 (Mughal era)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Wazir Khan Mosque is the Taj Mahal’s lesser-known cousin, but it is equally as stunning in design. The Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan was born in Lahore but died in Agra where he built the Taj Mahal to immortalise his wife Mumtaz Mahal. He also commissioned the Wazir Khan Mosque in the city of his birth.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt features brick muqarnas in most of its iwans and is decorated with square latticework and adorned with the names of the first four caliphs of Sunni Islam: Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman and Ali.\\n\\nMuqarnas Glossary + Show - Hide Iwan - a rectangular space that serves as an entrance into a mosque from a courtyard\\n\\nMihrab - a niche in mosque wall that indicates the direction of prayer for Muslim\\n\\nSquinch - a rounding of corners in the upper angles of a square room, allowing the creation of a dome\\n\\nFresco – a type of mural painted onto a wet plastered wall, as the plaster dries, so does the painting\\n\\nAblaq stonework – alternating rows of dark and light stonework, often found in Cairo and Damascus\\n\\nKashi-kari - originating from Kashan, Iran it’s the traditional glazed form of mosaic art that has decorated tiles\\n\\nRasmi-bandi - distinctive and original Persian patterns in traditional architecture providing ceiling coverage\\n\\nPendentive formation – triangular structures that come together to form a circular base\\n\\nLattice work: interlacing strips of material forming a lattice\\n\\nArabesque: ornamental design consisting of intertwined flowing lines\\n\\nIf you\\'ve spotted stunning muqarnas decorating a mosque or building - please send us your photos by tagging us on Twitter or Instagram and using the hashtag #MuqarnasMEE\\n\\nThis article is available in French on Middle East Eye French edition.',\n",
              " 'Contemporary imaginings of Istanbul are plenty. From Orhan Pamuk’s depictions of the Nisantasi district, to James Baldwin’s writings after he left the US and settled in the city, seeking refuge from racism.\\n\\nFor these authors and others, Istanbul is \"one of those cities\" - a melting pot and an able host, one with many characters, peoples and identities.\\n\\nHow Ertugrul resurrected the Muslim imagination Read More »\\n\\nTheirs is the Istanbul of coffee houses, meyhane (watering holes), nightclubs and meditations dreamt up gazing over vistas of the Bosphorus or Golden Horn.\\n\\nYet in these accounts of Istanbul, rooted firmly in the post-Ottoman Republican era, the city’s mosques play the part of an obliging supporting character at best, and the haggard remnant of an intrusive and overbearing past at worst.\\n\\nIn his ode to the city, Istanbul: Memories and the City, Pamuk describes “burned out” bulbs spelling out holy messages between the minarets of mosques and the “blackened” posters covering their walls.\\n\\nWhen Pamuk, the Nobel laureate, decides to paint, he chooses a back street in Beyoglu, Tarlabasi or Cihangir, where there are “very few mosques or minarets”.\\n\\n“This is indeed a city moving westward,” he declares later.\\n\\nThe Islamic city\\n\\nWhen reading Pamuk, it’s easy to forget the city’s mosques were once far more central to its identity.\\n\\nIstanbul’s mosques were not mere places of worship, but hubs of social interaction towards which scholars, students, merchants and men of politics gravitated.\\n\\nOnce an Eastern Roman city, Istanbul became the centre of the Ottoman sultanate, and thus became the sultanic city; an Islamic city, which would later be known for its thousand mosques.\\n\\nOttoman Turks led by Sultan Mehmet II conquered Constantinople from the Byzantines in 1453 (AFP)\\n\\nWhen Fatih Sultan Mehmet II conquered Constantinople in 1453, he went on an ambitious drive to Islamise the city, supplanting its Eastern Roman past, most notably by converting the Hagia Sophia into a mosque. The building of ornate places of worship subsequently became a way of cementing the Ottoman Islamic legacy onto the city’s landscape for successive sultans.\\n\\nBy the reign of Sultan Abdulhamid II (1876-1909), Istanbul was not simply an Islamic city but the Islamic city of the Muslim world, the city of the Ottoman caliphate and 400 years of Ottoman tradition.\\n\\nThe 19th century saw the Ottomans increasingly leaning on the office of the caliphate to cement their Islamic authority against the rise of nationalist currents. The city\\'s mosques took on a renewed transcendent symbolism within this context, as the Ottoman state sought to assert its supremacy with fresh vigour.\\n\\nTurkey goes back to the future as Hagia Sophia set for Islamic prayers Read More »\\n\\nIn the past, mosques like the Hagia Sophia, the Sultan Ahmed, the Fatih and the Suleymaniye, were much more than places of worship and gathering, but emblems of Ottoman rule and power.\\n\\nSuch was the importance of these great architectural feats that it was they that gave their name to the areas they were located in and not the other way round, as is the case even with upscale districts such as Tesvikiye and Cihangir - both named after mosques.\\n\\nBut while these monumental structures have their unique histories and are regular stops for tourists and locals alike, it is the last sultanic mosque built in Istanbul that is largely absent in the collective imagination.\\n\\nIt was a mosque that was supposed to usher in a new dawn for the Ottomans, the mosque of Sultan Abdulhamid II, the Yildiz Hamidiye Camii (Star mosque).\\n\\nYildiz a symbol of a new imagination\\n\\nFaced with territorial losses, outpaced in wealth and technology by its western counterparts and dealing with rising nationalist movements among non-Turkic subjects, the Ottoman authorities in the 19th century sought to rejuvenate the empire with a new unifying ideology: one that was rooted in Islam, was accepting of modernity and the diversity of the empire, and one in which an acknowledgement of Ottoman authority was absolute.\\n\\nThis effort would reach a climax during the Hamidian period - named for Abdulhamid II - where ideas of the modern were juxtaposed with Ottoman Islamic traditions.\\n\\nYildiz mosque sits on a hill in Istanbul\\'s Besiktas neighbourhood (Public archive)\\n\\nSuch ideals were imbued into the fabric of late Ottoman Istanbul and nothing represents their culmination more than the Yildiz mosque.\\n\\nThe house of worship was an extension of Ottoman attempts to establish an indigenous architectural style from 1873 onwards. Known as the Usul-i Mimari-yi Osmani (the Principles of Ottoman Architecture), the form was ostensibly rooted in classical Ottoman and Islamic tradition and yet was equally influenced by popular orientalist artistic styles from western Europe.\\n\\nSarkis Balyan of the Armenian Balyan dynasty served as the chief Ottoman architect when the Yildiz mosque was constructed (Public archive)\\n\\nUnder the stewardship of the Armenian Balyan family, an array of buildings and mosques were built all over the city to mark this new turn.\\n\\nMosques such as the Yeni Abdulmecid mosque in Ortakoy, the Pertevniyal Valide mosque in Aksaray and the Tesvikiye mosque in the district of Nisantasi are just some of the structures built during this period. One could say the Yildiz mosque was the apex of this trend.\\n\\nSplendour and prestige\\n\\nCompleted in 1886, the Yildiz mosque - officially known as the Hamidiye mosque - took two years to complete. The order to construct this innovative piece of architecture was handed to the chief state architect, Sarkis Balyan, who employed the Armenian architect Dikran Kalfa (Jüberian) to assist him.\\n\\nThe mosque has no real definitive style but we can observe that the exterior used a unique neo-Gothic facade that was Ottomanised, and the interior used Andalusian-influenced Moorish styles, which had become popular with Ottoman Muslim elites at the time and could also be seen in many other late interior designs.\\n\\nIts interior is beautifully painted, and crowned with a large chandelier sent as a gift by Kaiser Wilhelm II. The mosque’s dome is bright blue on the inside and painted with golden stars and a Quranic inscription from Surah Ikhlas by Ebuzziya Tevfik Bey.\\n\\nThe interior of the Yildiz mosque\\'s dome is decorated with Quranic calligraphy (Bilge Nesibe Kotan/MEE)\\n\\nThere are a host of distinct calligraphic styles on display, marking it as distinct from other Ottoman mosques. Notably, verses from Surah al-Mulk along the top wall were written in a Kufic script, originating in Iraq, by the famed calligrapher Abdulletif Efendi.\\n\\nAnother unique feature of the mosque is the wooden lattices made from cedarwood, which were handcrafted by Sultan Abdulhamid himself, a keen carpenter. These took their inspiration from the Alhambra in Granada, Spain, and are in addition to the lectern, which was also made by the Ottoman ruler.\\n\\nIn many ways the mosque can be seen as an insight into the way the Hamidian state imagined itself on a global scale: a state that straddled three continents - Europe, Asia and Africa; a state which saw itself as both modern and attached to is transforming tradition; but more importantly, a global power.\\n\\nThe mosque\\'s chandelier was donated by German Emperor Kaiser Wilhelm II (Bilge Nesibe Kotan/MEE)\\n\\nThe Yildiz mosque was the symbol of Abdulhamid’s vision of the Ottoman state as the modern imperial caliphate and a mosque of great splendour and prestige.\\n\\nA monument of the famous mosque was erected in Marjeh Square, Damascus, as the Hamidian state attempted to foster the notion of unity between its Arab subjects and the imperial centre. Yildiz mosque, by virtue of its diverse artistic and architectural influences, was therefore intended as a statement on the Islamic ideal of brotherhood between different peoples.\\n\\nPomp and ceremony\\n\\nOn its inauguration, the building comfortably took up its role as a sultanic mosque, drawing pomp in line with its imperial importance.\\n\\nRarely, if ever, did the masses see the sultan besides his weekly visits to Yildiz for the selamlik (Friday prayers).\\n\\nForeign dignitaries who attended the events would describe the spectacle of the sultan’s arrival, with excited crowds waiting in anticipation and then greeting the ruler in awe.\\n\\nA colourised image of Ottoman Sultan Abdulhamid II (pictured on the backseat of the carriage) arriving for Friday prayers at the Yildiz mosque (Public archive)\\n\\nThe occasion had an importance beyond the celebration of imperial regality - the Friday prayer had a distinct role in strengthening the image of the sultan in the eyes of Muslims around the world. The reading of the Friday sermon in the sultan’s name was a part of the ritual of establishing the legitimacy of Abdulhamid II and the Ottomans as caliphs to all Muslims.\\n\\nWhile Ottoman sultans in the past would perform their Friday prayers in Hagia Sophia, Suleymaniye or Sultan Ahmed Mosque, during the Hamidian period they were performed at Yildiz.\\n\\nBut the history of the mosque is notable for more than just the sultan’s ceremonial Friday prayer entrance. The building was also the site of one of the most dramatic and infamous episodes of Abdulhamid’s reign - an assassination attempt on the sultan by Armenian revolutionaries belonging to the Dashnak organisation on 21 July 1905.\\n\\nAbdulhamid escaped the assassination attempt but scores were killed and injured (L\\'Illustrazione Italiana, 1905)\\n\\nThe attempt at regicide, which involved a number of conspirators, saw an explosive-laden capsule placed under the carriage, which the sultan used to travel to the mosque.\\n\\nEverything was going according to plan for the plotters until the sultan chose to spend some time after the prayer talking to the Sheikh-ul-Islam, the most senior Islamic jurist in the Ottoman state. The conversation caused a rather fortuitous delay for the monarch, which ended up saving his life. Others were less fortunate, with 26 killed and dozens more injured, as well as serious damage to the outer section of the mosque and its clock tower.\\n\\nThe mosque survived Abdulhamid’s overthrow by the Young Turks in 1909 and continued to be the main sultanic mosque of the city during the First World War, with both Sultan Mehmed Reshad (Mehmet V) and Sultan Vahdettin (Mehmet VI) offering Friday prayers there.\\n\\nBy surviving his own reign, the mosque came to embody what Abdulhamid hoped it would symbolise: a structure that held firm to the sultanic tradition and which was a visual symbol of the Ottoman state. In a short period, it had become one of Istanbul’s most iconic mosques. That was until the collapse of the empire.\\n\\nThe Turkish Republic and the neglect of the sultanic heritage\\n\\nIn the years after the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1924, Istanbul saw its fortunes decline as the capital of the new state of Turkey was moved to Ankara.\\n\\nThe city’s many mosques, including Yildiz, were neglected as the rulers of the new state sought to prioritise modernisation along western lines to the detriment of the Islamic past under the Ottomans.\\n\\nFor many Ottoman monuments, this at times meant demolition to make way for new development projects and at other times neglect through lack of maintenance.\\n\\nSome decisions taken during this period remain contentious among Turks to this day. These include the conversion of the Hagia Sophia mosque into a museum, a decision that was reversed in 2020. There were even reports that officials were discussing the conversion of the Sultan Ahmet mosque (also known as the Blue Mosque) into an art gallery.\\n\\nFor Yildiz, the new era meant a period of decline, as much of its surrounding neighbourhoods underwent urban renewal.\\n\\nQuranic calligraphy inside the Yildiz mosque written in the Kufic style (Bilge Nesibe Kotan/MEE)\\n\\nFrom 1924 onwards, the French urban designer Henri Prost was enlisted to help redesign Istanbul.\\n\\nThe architect, who had previously worked for the French in Algeria, embarked on an ambitious but controversial campaign of redevelopment.\\n\\nIt was decided that large roads and streets would be created and, to make way, houses and Ottoman mosques would need to be cleared. The Besiktas area where Yildiz is located, was heavily transformed, with the mosque becoming virtually isolated on top of the hill.\\n\\nIt wasn’t until the two-party period after the Second World War that the government of Adnan Menderes recognised that Istanbul needed investment after much neglect.\\n\\nMenderes during his years in power had attempted to appease Muslim sentiment by once again allowing the recital of the Adhan in Arabic, which had until then been banned. The Democrat Party leader also refurbished many mosques and built the first mosque in Istanbul since Yildiz, in Sisli in 1949, a whole 63 years later.\\n\\nThis new mosque was built in the tradition of 16th-17th century Ottoman style, bypassing the Usul-i Mimari-yi Osmani trend institutionalised in 1870.\\n\\nFrench urban designer Henri Prost helped define modern Istanbul\\'s cityscape (AFP)\\n\\nDespite these nods to Turkey’s Ottoman heritage and a less conspicuous ideological motive than his predecessors, urban transformation policies under Menderes continued to relegate the significance of mosques such as Yildiz.\\n\\nDevelopment was the mantra of the day, and development projects continued along the lines of western modernisation with the city of Istanbul going through a significant transformation.\\n\\nIt wasn’t until the coming to power of the AK Party in the 2000s that moves to renovate many of Istanbul’s mosques became a priority. However, even in the AK Party period there have been continued tensions between the impulse to develop neighbourhoods and preserve historic monuments.\\n\\nIn the eyes of the preservationists, the ghost of urban development laid out by Prost continues to misshape the once imperial city.\\n\\nIn 2017, after four years of renovation, the Yildiz mosque was opened to the public in a refurbished state.\\n\\nSince then, many other mosques have been built across the city, but none in the style of Yildiz. What was once hoped to herald a new epoch for Ottoman culture has instead become a historic architectural anomaly.

              " 'Every year, Egyptians of all religions and backgrounds welcome spring with the celebration of Sham el-Nessim - meaning \"smell of the breeze\".\\n\\nThe national holiday, which has roots in Pharaonic traditions, is similar to the more widely known Iranian festival of Nowruz, which also symbolises the beginning of spring and renewal.\\n\\nHere, Middle East Eye answers some questions you might have about one of Egypt\\'s oldest festivals.\\n\\nWhen is Sham el-Nessim?\\n\\nThis year, Sham el-Nessim falls on 3 May. Every year, the celebration is marked one day after Coptic Easter.\\n\\nAmong western denominations, Easter typically falls between 22 March and 25 April in accordance with the Gregorian calendar. However, Coptic Christians celebrate Easter according to the Julian calendar, meaning the religious event is held later. This year they and other eastern denominations will mark Easter Sunday on 2 May.\\n\\nThe Sham el-Nessim celebration lasts for one day only, although people prepare for it days in advance by making traditional foods and planning outings.\\n\\nA family enjoys a picnic in Cairo to mark a festival that dates back almost 5,000 years (AFP)\\n\\nWhat are the origins of the festival?\\n\\nSham el-Nessim dates back to around 2700 BCE, when it was known as Shemu. During the springtime festival, ancient Egyptians would offer salted fish and other foods to their gods, to coincide with the spring equinox.\\n\\nDuring this period, which corresponds to the era of the Third Dynasty, the arrival of spring was a significant event for Egyptians, as the changing of the seasons had significance for the sowing, growth and harvesting of crops.\\n\\nFollowing the introduction of Christianity in Egypt in the first century CE, the celebration became associated with Coptic Easter, and was held annually on the day after Easter Sunday.\\n\\nThe name Sham el-Nessim derives from the Coptic language, which is itself derived from the ancient Egyptian language. The original pronunciation was \"tshom ni sime\", which means garden meadows. As Egypt became Arabised, the name was phono-semantically changed to \"sham el-nessim\", which means \"smelling the breeze\" in Arabic.\\n\\nThe occasion was also called \"feast of shmo\" by some, meaning the revival of life.\\n\\nWho celebrates Sham el-Nessim?\\n\\nEveryone. Sham el-Nessim is one of the very few festivals that is celebrated by Egyptians regardless of their faith, because it predates both Christianity and Islam.\\n\\nBoat rides and fairgrounds are hugely popular on Sham el-Nessim (AFP)\\n\\nHow do people celebrate Sham el-Nessim?\\n\\nFamilies and friends welcome the warmer spring weather by meeting for picnics in open spaces, such as gardens and parks, and even by the banks of the Nile.\\n\\nWhile picnicking, people often play music and compete in games. One of the most popular songs associated with the occasion is El donya rabee (It’s Springtime) by popular Egyptian actor and singer Soad Hosny, who was known as the “cinderella of Egyptian cinema” when she ascended to stardom in the 1950s. Another popular song is Adi el rabee ad men tany (Here is Spring Once Again) by singer and composer Farid al-Atrash. He was sometimes referred to as the \"King of the Oud\", as he recorded over 500 songs and starred in over 30 films. He was considered one of the most influential and important figures in 20th-century Arabic music.\\n\\nOthers celebrate the day by visiting zoos or beaches, or one of the many fairgrounds that pop up around the country for the occasion, with slides and rides to entertain children.\\n\\nAnother tradition during Sham el-Nessim is painting and decorating boiled eggs using dye. Typically, families will boil the eggs the night before, and spend the day adorning them with various designs. The use of eggs symbolises rebirth and renewal. Some people choose to write wishes on the eggs and hang them on trees or their houses, in the hopes that they will come true.\\n\\nChildren decorate eggs in the Nile delta city of Mansura to symbolise renewal (AFP)\\n\\nWhat do people eat on Sham el-Nessim?\\n\\nThere are a number of foods quintessentially associated with the holiday. One of the most popular is fisikh - a fermented and heavily salted grey mullet fish. This delicacy is so pungent, most families will not consume it indoors or in their homes.\\n\\nEvery year, warnings are issued by Egypt’s Ministry of Health about food poisoning during Sham el-Nessim. If it is not made carefully, fisikh can be rotten and can cause botulism – reports state that 18 people died from eating it in 1991. Advice issued by officials encourages people to eat fisikh in moderation and inspect it for any signs of contamination or rotting.\\n\\nThe fish is prepared by drying it in the sun, and it is often left in salt from several months to a year before consuming. Although traditionally people made fisikh in their homes, many now buy it ready-made from shops to avoid making their homes smell.\\n\\nAround the holiday, specialist shops will increase their sales of fisikh, due to high demand for the food. A person that specialises in making the food is called a fasakhani. People often choose to eat the fish with bread, and squeeze lemon juice on it to make it more digestible.\\n\\nEgyptians queue up to buy mullet fish, to make into fisikh (AFP)\\n\\nAlongside the fisikh and other types of salted fish such as herring, people will eat spring onions and lettuce. The greens are thought to aid digestion and act as a balance to the high salt levels in the fish.\\n\\nMany believe that the tradition of consuming fish on the holiday dates back to Pharaonic times, when people would offer the food to their gods in the city of Esna in upper Egypt. The city’s original name, Latopolis, is believed to derive from the word for fish before it is salted.\\n\\nAccording to Egyptian legend, the tradition of eating onions originates in an incident where the Pharaoh\\'s daughter was believed to have an incurable disease, and onions were used to help cure her condition. Others say it wards off evil spirits.\\n\\nFor those who can’t stomach fisikh, stuffed vine leaves are a popular option consumed across the Middle East, with various twists made to the dish depending on the region.\\n\\nA popular snack eaten by Egyptians during Sham el-Nessim is termes - or lupin beans. People snack on these while taking walks by the Nile or a beach, and many enjoy them as a snack while having guests over or watching a film, as an alternative to popcorn.\\n\\nThe street-food snack is usually sold by street vendors and carts across Egypt, and is typically served in paper cones with a dash of lemon and chilli flakes.\\n\\nTo make termes, the lupin beans must first be soaked overnight. After boiling, the beans turn to a bright yellow colour. They are then left in fresh water and topped with salt and lemon juice. To eat them, the outer shell is peeled off, leaving only the bean inside.\\n\\nWill coronavirus impact Sham el-Nessim?\\n\\nThis year, due to the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, public gatherings are likely to be banned. Although the day is a national holiday, Covid-19 restrictions will prevent people from marking the occasion together in traditional ways.\\n\\nFamilies may choose to spend the day in a more subdued manner, as fairgrounds and parks will most likely be closed. With social distancing measures and curfews being enforced in many parts of the world, many people have been isolated from their friends and families, with restrictions being placed on travel and the opening hours of shops.\\n\\nLast year, Egypt ordered the closure of all public parks, beaches and public transport during the holiday, in order to prevent large gatherings amid the spread of the virus. This year, restrictions were imposed for Ramadan amid a fear of a rise in cases. This is likely to be the case for other religious and cultural festivals.\\n\\nAs a result, many people have resorted to online video-conferencing platforms such as Zoom to communicate with loved ones on such occasions.',\n",
              " 'In 2009, gaming heavyweight Konami announced it would publish Six Days in Fallujah, a first-person shooter game set during the second Battle of Fallujah - a gruelling struggle between American-led forces and Iraqi armed groups, which lasted six weeks in the winter of 2004.\\n\\nThe offensive involving US and British troops, who eventually captured the city, left at least 800 civilians dead, according to the International Red Cross, making it one of the bloodiest battles of the Iraq War. Even five years after the battle, plans to release a game centred around the memories of the events created huge controversy, which resulted in Konami dropping the title.\\n\\nWith the local and regional fallout of the Iraq invasion now spanning nearly two decades, the entire episode is seen by many analysts as an unmitigated disaster. It’s therefore even more shocking to see the game return from the dead.\\n\\nIsraeli army bans soldiers from playing Pokemon Go Read More »\\n\\nNow in the hands of Highwire Games, a studio made up of the developers behind the popular Halo and Destiny franchises, new publisher Victura announced in February that the game would be released at some point this year.\\n\\nGiven the soul-searching that followed the start of the war and the fact that there is a genealogy linking the invasion and the later development of the Islamic State (IS) group, you would think the creators of the game would have used the decade since it was dropped for some introspection. Instead of going back to the drawing board or dropping the game entirely, however, Victura and Highwire decided to awaken Six Days in Fallujah from its 11-year slumber.\\n\\nWhose narrative?\\n\\nThere are many reasons to place a permanently suspicious side-eye to this spectacle. Peter Tamte, head of Victura, gave some worrying answers to pop culture and gaming site Polygon in response to the collective scepticism gaming aficionados such as this author have.\\n\\n“We do want to show how choices that are made by policymakers affect the choices that [a marine] needs to make on the battlefield,” he said, showing some signs of the required self-awareness needed to demonstrate the complexity of warfare. However, he continued: “Just as that [marine] cannot second-guess the choices by the policymakers, we’re not trying to make a political commentary about whether or not the war itself was a good or a bad idea.”\\n\\nIt’s this second bit that immediately dissolves all of Victura’s credibility, even more than the cop-out, dual-narrative set-up created by Highwire, where you follow an Iraqi family fleeing from the violence, alongside the shooting gallery offered to the player, through the eyes of an American soldier.\\n\\nToo often there are people who use the smokescreen of \"avoiding politics\" to absolve their own political principles from receiving any sort of criticism. The mind bends trying to untangle the cognitive dissonance required to claim a game about an actual war, in which people are shot at and in which people have the choice to shoot, can be anything but political.\\n\\nThe widely condemned disaster of the Iraq War has created a perfect opportunity for an engaging narrative that could expose the flaws not just of the overall war, but specific episodes, such as that of Fallujah.\\n\\nInstead, Six Days in Fallujah seems destined to fall into a genre of creative output, which compartmentalises, by virtue of its focus on the experience of the US soldier, aspects of war that can never be separated. Every bullet shot has a narrative attached to both the person doing the shooting and the person on the receiving end. Victura and Highwire, by putting players primarily in control of a marine, choose to prioritise one of those narratives over the other. It is therefore the narrative the player experiences - that of the marine - that matters, not anyone else’s.\\n\\nHouse of horror: Virtual reality film depicts Islamic State devastation in Fallujah Read More »\\n\\nHighwire’s attempts to placate this concern by pointing to the subplot about a fleeing Iraqi family is simply not enough, abdicating responsibility by creating a false sense of balance. The effect of the war on ordinary Iraqis was about more than just running away from fighting and the impact of this specific battle remains visibly present. In just one example, years after the battle, survivors were giving birth to children with hugely increased numbers of defects and pediatric cancers.\\n\\nFaux-strategists sitting in armchairs and cheerleaders of the war, as well as those trying to remain \"neutral\", such as Tamte, aren’t particularly interested in those details. It has ended up making the stories of war they produce - whatever the medium - stale and futile. High-profile developers seem unable to focus on any retelling of the Iraq War solely from the perspective of the ordinary people affected by it.\\n\\nSince the resurfacing of the controversy, Victura has said that the events portrayed in the game are \"inseperable from politics\" but added that it has worked to ensure it includes multiple perspectives.\\n\\nAn industry-wide problem\\n\\nSappy stories to elicit empathy for US troops have never been the best vehicle to understand the nuances of war, especially in the shooter genre. Back in 2005, Ubisoft brought Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30 to the market to prove otherwise. The game was praised for its attention to detail and for allowing players to follow the actual missions of real-life soldiers in World War Two. However, support for the allies in that particular war is much easier to digest for most, principally due to the atrocities blamed on the people they were fighting and the eventual formation of repentant and renewed governments in both Germany and Japan.\\n\\nSince that release, most big-name studios seemed to have doubled down on creating war-based shooters or military-themed games without any semblance of nuance. Splinter Cell: Double Agent included a storyline of a Pakistani nuclear scientist selling dangerous materials, and eventually having his assassination authorised by the National Security Agency. Spec Ops: The Line follows Afghan-war veterans fighting in a follow-up war in sandstorm-hit Dubai. There was even a Blackwater game, celebrating Erik Prince’s infamous mercenary outfit, which was notably (and mercifully) awarded Giant Bomb’s Worst Game of the Year accolade. And before Call of Duty decided to bring a wrinkly Ronald Reagan back to life in its most recent instalment, it gave players the opportunity to literally blast bullets indiscriminately at civilians in an airport.\\n\\nMaybe we should be thankful they’re less on-the-nose than 2003’s America’s 10 Most Wanted, which had you capture figures such as Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden. This military-video game industrial complex has led to an absurdist Twitter account showing which video games allow you to violate the Geneva Conventions and in what ways.\\n\\nIsrael\\'s Fauda: Immoral drama turns Palestinian suffering into entertainment Read More »\\n\\nThe silver lining about the ever-increasing ubiquity and mainstream enjoyment of video games is that it has brought huge opportunities for some developers to take creative risks and challenge our views on a range of complex topics. Papers, Please remains one of the gold standards, where you control a border crossing in a fictional Eastern European country, balancing your personal finances and the faceless bureaucratic orders from above in order to survive. But such offerings are exceptions rather than the rule.\\n\\nIn their place, we’re left with games about Arabs, the Middle East or brown people in general where developers aren’t even bothered to get the language right. The most recent example of this has come from the latest Hitman game, with Arabic incorrectly displayed from left to right in nonsense-level translation. As a side note, a previous Hitman game depicted Sikhs being killed in the holy Golden Temple, a highly insensitive choice given the deaths of hundreds of Sikhs at the Amritsar temple in 1984. It goes to show how little of an afterthought non-western cultures are at many gaming studios, where repeated mistakes are often ignored.\\n\\nThe root problem to avoiding military whitewashing, continuous errors and displays of ignorance within the medium is the need for more prominent Arab, African and South Asian gaming studios. These are places that don’t currently have the necessary funding for developers to fulfil their creative dreams, compared to other parts of the world. And although Japan and Europe (especially the UK) have been at the forefront of game development since the beginning, it seems to be a fixation for US developers to continually share stories of heroic troops in combat.\\n\\nThe US army has taken note, attempting to recruit newcomers via Twitch. But the current stalemate of bland-but-popular military games isn’t sustainable in this growing market and eventually it’ll have to make way, hopefully for something original, inclusive and much more exciting.\\n\\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.\\n\\nThis article is available in French on Middle East Eye French edition.',\n",
              " 'Ahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix, former F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone tells MEE how the motorsport came to the Middle East, as activists highlight abuses\\n\\nBernie Ecclestone, the man who ran Formula One for four decades, is recalling the deal that took the motorsport to Bahrain in 2004.\\n\\n“When we first went there we had a bit of trouble with the local people, who were upset about what they thought the rulers were doing,” the 90-year-old British business magnate tells Middle East Eye.\\n\\n“In the end, I met all the protesters and really sat with them and talked to them. I said to them at the time, ‘What you’re looking for is a revolution, really’. That’s what normally happens. And then you attack the crown and capture the country. I said that’s the only thing you can ever do.”\\n\\n\\'I met all the protesters and really sat with them and talked to them. I said to them at the time, ‘What you’re looking for is a revolution, really’\\' - Bernie Ecclestone\\n\\nEcclestone wasn’t expecting Bahrain’s barricades to be stormed, though. “I mentioned that was what would normally happen when these things happen, knowing full well there was no way in the world it could happen because they would never be able to do that.”\\n\\nSpeaking from his home in the Swiss Alpine resort town of Gstaad, Ecclestone says he used to travel to Bahrain “without all the so-called bodyguards,” meeting opposition groups and the kingdom’s rulers at his hotel.\\n\\nThe idea for staging a race had come from the island kingdom. The Cambridge-educated Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa became Bahrain’s crown prince in 1999, a few months before his 30th birthday.\\n\\nSalman got in touch with Ecclestone, who found the young royal to be a “very nice person” and a “very good leader”.\\n\\n“He was completely behind this because he realised that it would be the best thing that could happen for the country,” says Ecclestone. “It was a case of pointing out what was best for everyone.”\\n\\nBahrain Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa (L) with Bernie Ecclestone during the 2012 Bahrain Grand Prix (AFP)\\n\\nOn this, Bahrain’s ruling Khalifa family and the F1 supremo were aligned. Hosting a Grand Prix would put the kingdom on the map, open it up to foreign investment and make it a more attractive destination for tourists.\\n\\nFor the motorsport, it meant new revenue streams in the wake of the loss of sponsorship from tobacco companies and expansion into the Middle East, which had never hosted a race.\\n\\n“We’d been calling ourselves a world championship for years, and we were a European championship,” says Ecclestone. “I thought Bahrain would be great. It’s another part of the world. Normally people would have no reason to go there. So we’ve opened the door for people doing business... Using the sport to open doors that probably would never have been opened.”\\n\\nConstruction of the Bahrain International Circuit in Sakhir began in 2002 and cost $150m. The first race took place on 4 April 2004 and was won by Michael Schumacher, driving a Ferrari.\\n\\n“Nobody believed there was ever going to be a race in that part of the world,” says Ecclestone. “Bahrain had the courage to do it. I said to the crown prince – he’d opened the door to the Middle East countries – we won’t race anywhere without your blessing. So when it was the case of meeting Abu Dhabi to discuss everything there, I said to them you have to get the okay from Bahrain.”\\n\\nBy May 2007, Abu Dhabi was building a race track of its own. The Yas Marina Circuit cost $1.3bn and involved the creation of a manmade island. Like the circuit at Bahrain, it is, F1 insiders say, the best of the best, complete with top-of-the-line facilities.\\n\\n\\'It suited us and it suited them. You have to pay the price for that. They realised it was cheap anyway for the amount of publicity they got\\' - Bernie Ecclestone\\n\\nEcclestone was very impressed when he first met the “charming” Mohammed bin Zayed, Abu Dhabi’s crown prince, who had initiated talks about bringing F1 to the emirate. The two men had dinner at an outdoor restaurant with two others, whom Ecclestone identifies as bin Zayed’s “right-hand man” and “somebody”. No bodyguards were present.\\n\\n“When we left the restaurant we walked to a car, he [MBZ] drove the car himself and was just very, very normal, nice people, not trying to impress anyone; that’s what I liked more than anything.”\\n\\nThe F1 chief told bin Zayed it would be very difficult to have a street race in Abu Dhabi because of the US-style grid system in the city.\\n\\nBin Zayed told Ecclestone not to worry, that they’d build an area big enough to put a racetrack on. “I said fine, that would be super but you understand how difficult that would be – and what did they do? They built the island. If somebody said that to you, you’d probably think: ‘What are they talking about?’”\\n\\nWhat appealed to the F1 man was the way rulers in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi did exactly what they said they were going to do. Ecclestone happily acknowledges that he thinks one of Europe\\'s big problems is “too much democracy”. He is a friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who he describes as a “nice, nice, nice person,” as well as a formidable leader.\\n\\n“He\\'s another one of these guys that do exactly what they say they are going to do,” Ecclestone says, drawing a direct link between Putin and the Gulf kingdoms. “They don’t change their minds halfway. They make it work.”\\n\\nManchester City, Abu Dhabi and the rise of English football\\'s new order Read More »\\n\\nAt the same time as Abu Dhabi’s circuit was being constructed, in 2008, Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed, an Emirati royal, bought Manchester City Football Club. “They had opened their eyes to sport, they could see that Formula One was good for them, and they could see the connection,” Ecclestone says.\\n\\n“They’ve become very much part of the world now, whereas before they were very isolated.”\\n\\nFor Ecclestone, it was a win-win situation. “Financially, the people we are dealing with in this part of the world value things differently than the people who have been around for years,” he says.\\n\\nThe sport makes much more money from races in the Middle East than it does from those on circuits such as Monaco and Silverstone, which are known around the world and whose tracks hold the history of racing deep in their tarmac.\\n\\nSpeaking about F1 and the Gulf kingdom’s rulers, Ecclestone says: “This is what you wanted to do, to use the brand to promote the country, which is what they wanted to do obviously. It suited us and it suited them. You have to pay the price for that. They realised it was cheap anyway for the amount of publicity they got. We all knew exactly what we were doing. And by luck, I think, it worked out all right.”\\n\\nThis season, the first Saudi Arabian Grand Prix will take place. It is the first Grand Prix whose deal was not done by Ecclestone. But without those dinners at hotels in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi, it would never have come to pass.\\n\\nThe Bahrain opener\\n\\nThis Sunday’s season-opening Grand Prix in Bahrain will take place a decade after F1 cancelled the race, after the government crushed the 2011 protests that rose up in the wake of the Arab Spring.\\n\\nIt is an event that sits at the heart of a debate around “sportswashing,” or the use of sporting events by governments and large corporations to burnish their brand, build soft power and deflect attention away from all manner of abuses.\\n\\nBack in 2011, dozens of protesters calling for democratic change including an elected prime minister and a constitutional monarchy were killed and thousands arrested. Among their number was Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, who is now the director of advocacy for the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (Bird).\\n\\nF1 returned to Bahrain the following year, but popular protests against the race have continued. “Desperate to project an image of normality to the world, Bahrain police have routinely suppressed these protests with violence,” says Alwadaei.\\n\\nAssaulted, tortured and imprisoned\\n\\nIn 2012, Salah Abbas was shot dead by police at a protest on the eve of the Grand Prix. That same year, Alwadaei says he was shot by police with birdshot and tear gas for joining similar anti-F1 protests. He left Bahrain and became a refugee in the UK. Three years later, his Bahraini nationality was revoked. The human rights activist remains a stateless person to this day.\\n\\nLike Alwadaei, Najah Yusuf has personal experience of the direct link between Bahrain’s ruling class and Formula One. In 2017, the then-civil servant and mother-of-four criticised F1 and the Bahraini government in a Facebook post, with the court judgement against her saying she had written that the Grand Prix was “nothing more than a way for the al-Khalifa family to whitewash their criminal record and gross human rights violations”.\\n\\nYusuf says she was assaulted, tortured and imprisoned for three years following the post, with officers at the Muharraq police station beating and threatening to rape her until she signed a prepared confession.\\n\\nThe Bahraini activist told a virtual press conference organised by Bird that, thanks to international pressure, she was released in August 2019 and that soon after the UN declared her detention arbitrary and called for her to be compensated.\\n\\n“My only offence was posting criticism of F1 on social media,” Yusuf says. “In Bahrain, it’s enough to see you tortured and thrown in jail for years.”\\n\\n\\'I’ve lost faith that F1 will ever help me get justice. For us Bahrainis, this is about more than just a motor race\\' - Najah Yusuf\\n\\nShe maintains that, while F1 promised to help her, they have done nothing. “I continue to face harassment from Bahrain’s government because I refuse to remain silent about my ordeal.”\\n\\nMore than that, Yusuf’s son Kameel Juma Hasan was arrested when he was just 16 for taking part in opposition demonstrations and now faces up to 27 years in prison. Amnesty International has called his arrest a “reprisal against him and his family after he and his mother refused to become informants and his mother spoke out in the international press”.\\n\\nSince the UN ruled that her detention was arbitrary, F1 “has made no attempt to meet me,” says Yusuf.\\n\\n“I’ve lost faith that F1 will ever help me get justice. For us Bahrainis, this is about more than just a motor race. This is about companies coming to Bahrain and giving the government a stage to show how modern and progressive they are, while protesters are shot down in the streets.”\\n\\nIn 2015, F1 formally adopted a human rights policy for the first time. At the Bird press conference, it was clear that Bahraini activists felt that while the policy had promised to herald a new dawn, six years on it wasn’t working.\\n\\n“Until today, we are still seeing protests against F1 violently suppressed and critics of the race thrown in prison, while F1’s management bury their heads in the sand,” said Alwadaei.\\n\\nHamilton speaks out\\n\\nWhile Bahrain’s activists are giving up on F1’s management to help their cause, some have looked instead to seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton, who has begun to speak out on issues of human rights and racial justice.\\n\\nBorn in 1985 in the English town of Stevenage, Hamilton is the first and only Black driver to race in F1. A go-karting prodigy, he was signed to the McLaren young driver programme at the age of 12, going on to finish runner-up in his first F1 season in 2007, aged 22.\\n\\nHaving effectively turned professional as a teenager, Hamilton’s childhood was far from normal. “I was groomed and restricted and felt that was the only space I was allowed to be in,” he once told GQ magazine.\\n\\nHe was surrounded by PR people, told what to wear and told what to say. Ron Dennis, the man who ran McLaren for decades, was known to strictly control what his drivers did and did not say. Dennis became so well known for finding complicated ways of saying almost nothing, that the term “Ronspeak” was coined. It was a mode his drivers, Hamilton included, sometimes dropped into.\\n\\nIn September 2012, Hamilton shocked the racing world by announcing that he was leaving McLaren for Mercedes.\\n\\n“It was only then that I started to make my own decisions in life,” he said. The greater freedom afforded to him by Mercedes has seen him embrace a jet-setting lifestyle.\\n\\nLewis Hamilton (R) and other Formula One drivers take the knee ahead of the Austrian Grand Prix in July 2020 (AFP)\\n\\nHe lives in the tax haven of Monaco and parties around the world, pictured alongside Rihanna, Rita Ora and Nicki Minaj. He’s making an album. He owns a massive ranch in Colorado. In return, Hamilton has won championship after championship for Mercedes.\\n\\nAt the same time, the once shy boy obsessed with motor racing has begun to go through what one F1 insider described as a “more typical adolescence”.\\n\\nThis has included a public political awakening of sorts. The murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by US police in May 2020, left Hamilton “overcome with rage”. He has made his support for the Black Lives Matter movement public, taking a knee and wearing a BLM t-shirt on the starting grid before races.\\n\\nOn 11 June 2020, Hamilton posted a reading list on Twitter that included Malcolm X’s autobiography, Alice Walker’s The Colour Purple, and There Ain’t No Black in the Union Jack, the first book by the renowned Black British academic Paul Gilroy.\\n\\n“I don’t think Lewis has read the book – no disrespect to him,” Gilroy tells Middle East Eye. “The thing about that book is that because of the title, it’s always attracted a certain interest that it doesn’t really merit... People are always rather shocked if you tell them that it was a National Front slogan that people chanted at cricket matches and so on. I don’t mind him telling people they should try and read it – good luck to them.”\\n\\n\\'I don’t think we should be going to these countries and just ignoring what is happening in those places, arriving having a great time and then leave\\' - Lewis Hamilton\\n\\nGilroy sees Hamilton’s activism as “more interesting as an example of celebrity – the sort of power of celebrity in that moment and the particular kind of celebrity he is.\\n\\n“I’ve not watched the video of George Floyd being murdered, but I’m sure Lewis has, and if it woke him up then so much the better,” Gilroy says.\\n\\n“I’m not going to complain if the appalling shock of that murder wakes him up and alerts him to the - dare I say it - responsibilities that follow from the kind of visibility and celebrity that he has acquired. If that happens, then that’s got to be a good thing.”\\n\\nHamilton’s support for Black Lives Matter has been followed by a willingness to listen to Bahraini activists. At the press conference organised by Bird, 11-year-old Ahmed Ramadhan described how, for most of his life, his father Mohammed had been on death row in Bahrain, after he was convicted of murdering a policeman.\\n\\nAmnesty International has called Mohammed’s trial “grossly unfair,” and it is widely alleged that the conviction was based on confessions extracted by torture. Mohammed Ramadhan is a member of Sunni-led Bahrain’s Shia community, and his arrest came in the wake of anti-government protests. Ahmed was four years old the last time his father picked him up from school.\\n\\nLast year, Hamilton read a letter from Ahmed’s father. “I was so excited,” the 11-year old said. “He’s my favourite driver ever, and I always drive as him on my Real Racing game, so I drew a picture of his car for him.” Ahmed’s father saw the drawing on the news and told his son how proud he was of him.\\n\\nAt a press conference on Thursday evening, Hamilton was asked about the letters he received from Bahraini torture survivors before last year’s race. The driver said the letters had “weighed quite heavily one me,” and that it was “the first time I’d received letters like that”.\\n\\nA drawing by 11-year-old Ahmed Ramadhan which he sent with a letter to Lewis Hamilton (Supplied)\\n\\nHamilton says he has met the British ambassador in Bahrain and has spoken to Bahraini officials.\\n\\n“At the moment, the steps I’ve taken have been in private, and I think that’s the right way to go about it, so I don’t want to jeopardise any progress,” he said. “But yes, that’s the position we’re in now, and I’m definitely committed to helping in any way I can.”\\n\\nHamilton continued: “In terms of whether it’s Formula One’s responsibility, I don’t know if that’s for me to say... But I don’t think we should be going to these countries and just ignoring what is happening in those places, arriving, having a great time and then leave.”\\n\\nA spokesperson for the FIA, Formula One\\'s governing body, told Middle East Eye:\\n\\n\"We have always been clear with all race promoters and governments with which we deal worldwide that we take violence, abuse of human rights and repression very seriously.\\n\\n\"Formula One\\'s human rights policy is very clear and states that the Formula One companies are committed to respecting internationally recognised human rights in its operations globally and have made our position on human rights clear to all our partners, including the drivers, as well as the host countries who commit to respect human rights in the way their events are hosted and delivered.\"\\n\\nThe Bahraini embassy in London did not respond to Middle East Eye’s request for comment.\\n\\n\\'They\\'d [F1 owners] only be interested if it was politically difficult for them and if their share price dropped\\' - Bernie Ecclestone\\n\\nBahrain\\'s government has previously said that it \"has a zero-tolerance policy towards mistreatment of any kind and has put in place internationally recognised human rights safeguards”.\\n\\n“They don’t seem to be,” Bernie Ecclestone said, when asked if F1’s owners are worried about Lewis Hamilton’s burgeoning activism. “They’d only be interested if it was politically difficult for them and if their share price dropped.”\\n\\nPaul Scriven, a member of the British House of Lords who has shown a particular interest in Bahrain, told MEE it appeared that F1’s senior leadership were putting profits before any moral obligations.\\n\\nThat, in part, explains the decision to try to involve Hamilton. He and his fellow campaigners are preparing to put the spotlight on F1’s corporate sponsors and “appeal directly to their consumers”.\\n\\nFor the moment, a lot of hope is being placed in Hamilton. It may not entirely be in vain. British observers need only look to the footballer Marcus Rashford to see what can happen when a sportsman dedicates himself to political activism.\\n\\n“I was surprised when he took up the issue of what was going on in Bahrain and I was pleased,” says Paul Gilroy of Hamilton.\\n\\n“I want to leave open the possibility that if the right pressure is applied and if the right conversations are had, something can happen. He’s not as vulnerable as he was on the way up; he’s on the plateau now so he can afford to take some risks.\\n\\n“If he gets into those conversations, who’s to say that this is the end of it?”\\n\\nThis article is available in French on Middle East Eye French edition.',\n",
              " 'Prime Minister Boris Johnson has talked of cutting the BBC down to size, and the licence fee is under attack as never before\\n\\nThis year sees the launch of a new and potentially serious challenge to existing broadcasters: Rupert Murdoch’s News UK is launching a new cable TV news channel. Another cable channel, GB News, backed by £60m ($83m) of capital and fronted by the broadcaster and journalist Andrew Neil, is also about to launch.\\n\\nBoth are targeting disaffected BBC viewers. GB News will be aimed at “the vast number of British people who feel underserved and unheard by their media”. According to the channel’s chief executive, it will be “proudly independent and fearless in tackling the issues people care about”.\\n\\nEven now, however, in times of crisis, the public do not turn to the billionaire press for their news. They turn to the BBC\\n\\nMaybe. Albeit from a right-of-centre perspective, Neil is certainly a journalist with a healthy respect for evidence, but behind him lurk some usual suspects: a handful of foreign-based billionaires and corporations with very deep pockets.\\n\\nNor is it quite true to say that GB’s target audience are “underserved and unheard” by existing media. At least so far as written media is concerned, Brexiteers, English nationalists and the un-woke are somewhat over-represented, and most of our newspaper journalism cannot be said to be either “fearless” or “balanced”, let alone “independent”.\\n\\nFor good, historical reasons, however, different standards prevail in broadcast media. From its inception, broadcasting - the BBC in particular - has been strictly regulated on the grounds that in the wrong hands, so large a monopoly (or near monopoly) would become a dangerous weapon. Only in recent years has the consensus surrounding the regulation of the broadcast media begun to fray. Even now, however, in times of crisis, the public do not turn to the billionaire press for their news. They turn to the BBC.\\n\\nIt may well be argued that a £60m news channel hardly represents a threat to the mighty BBC - and on paper, this would be true, but for the fact that the ambitions of those behind GB News happen to be shared by people in high places. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has talked of cutting the BBC down to size, and the licence fee is under attack as never before. The backers of this new enterprise have chosen a good moment to strike.\\n\\nThe digital age\\n\\nOn several occasions during my 23 years in parliament, we debated legislation concerned with regulation of broadcast media. Latterly, this involved discussion of how to manage the coming digital age. What was striking about many of the contributions from the Tory side, however, was the extent to which they included attacks on the BBC, even though this was often irrelevant to the legislation under discussion.\\n\\nIn January 2009, I attended a breakfast meeting with Ed Richards, then the chief executive of the broadcasting regulator Ofcom. His theme was the likely impact of digitalisation. His prognosis was gloomy: we were moving rapidly down the American road - hundreds of television channels with little worth watching on any of them.\\n\\nBBC Trojan Horse report: Failing to put right shocking falsehoods Read More »\\n\\nGoogle and satellite television were, he said, gradually dragging the terrestrial channels downmarket. “Soon,” he said, “we will be in a position where only the BBC will have the resources for original programming.” It was apparent, however, that the Tories present did not share his concern. They thought the BBC was the problem.\\n\\nEight months later, at the Edinburgh International Television Festival, James Murdoch delivered the prestigious MacTaggart lecture. That, too, was an assault on the BBC and what he called “state-sponsored journalism”. He spoke of “excessive regulation”, a need for “trusting and empowering consumers”, and for “private enterprise and profit” to become “a driver of investment”.\\n\\nHe went on: “We have a system in which state-sponsored media - the BBC in particular - grow ever more dominant. That process has to be reversed … We must have genuine independence in news media.”\\n\\nThe case for regulation\\n\\nHe was not entirely wrong. There is a respectable argument that the BBC, funded as it is by the licence payer, has become bloated and has extended into areas best left to the market. It is also arguable that the plurality of outlets reduces the case for regulating commercial broadcasting.\\n\\nHowever, to hear a scion of the Murdoch empire calling for “genuine independence in news media” inevitably provoked cynicism. In a nutshell, the case for continued regulation is precisely to stop our broadcast media falling into the hands of those who control our newspapers, with all the attendant abuses. One has only to look at Fox News and other satellite channels in the US to see where this road leads.\\n\\nMedia mogul Rupert Murdoch and his sons, James and Lachlan, are pictured in Idaho in 2013 (Getty Images via AFP)\\n\\nIn a parliamentary debate in July 2011, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown accused James Murdoch and News International of pressing the government to undermine the BBC in pursuit of its own commercial interests.\\n\\n“Their aim was to cut the BBC licence fee, to force BBC online to charge for content, for the BBC to sell off its commercial activities, to open up more national sporting events to bids from BSkyB and move them away from the BBC, to open up the cable and satellite infrastructure market, and to reduce the power of their regulator, Ofcom. I rejected these policies.” Brown may have done but, as we shall see, his Tory successor didn’t.\\n\\nVoice of the establishment\\n\\nThe Tories have not always harboured a grievance against the BBC. For decades, it was the voice of the establishment. Most BBC executives and correspondents were drawn from the upper-middle class. They spoke with the clipped tones of officers addressing the other ranks.\\n\\nAt times of national emergency - the 1926 general strike for example - the corporation could be relied upon to lean heavily towards the government’s version of events. And just in case anyone was tempted to stray too far off course, the state took precautions to keep them on the straight and narrow.\\n\\nThe standards of reporting at the BBC were high and slotted easily into the postwar consensus. Only as the consensus began to fray did cracks become visible\\n\\nFrom the mid-1930s on, applicants for editorial and executive jobs at the BBC were vetted by security services. This continued for six decades. In the 1980s, Brigadier Ronnie Stonham was discovered in room 105 at Broadcasting House, the headquarters of the BBC, stamping Christmas trees on the personnel files of those whose careers were not to progress. His job was to liaise with security services with a view to vetting applicants for employment for evidence of ideological unsoundness.\\n\\nIn the early days, this was no doubt deemed necessary by the powers-that-be to prevent fascist or communist sympathisers from infecting the airwaves - but many of those whose careers were blighted by Stonham’s Christmas trees were left-of-centre liberals whose views today would not be controversial. Interestingly, when at the end of the Cold War, the security services themselves suggested that vetting might no longer be necessary, senior BBC managers insisted that it continue, although they were persuaded to reduce the number of posts subject to scrutiny.\\n\\nNevertheless, as late as the early 1990s, about 3,000 individuals, an eighth of the BBC workforce, were still subject to vetting. Internal guidance for senior management suggested that, if asked about security-service vetting, they were to obfuscate.\\n\\nCaught red-handed\\n\\nNot long after Stonham was outed, I was among a party of MPs entertained to lunch at Broadcasting House by Marmaduke Hussey, the rather grand Tory gentleman who was then chairman of the BBC board. The purpose of the lunch was to bend our ear on the Broadcasting Act, then just a gleam in Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s eye.\\n\\nHalfway through the lunch, I inquired: “Who now works in room 105 now that Brigadier Stonham has retired?” The room suddenly fell quiet. From around the table came the sound of knives and forks hitting plates. “I think this is one for you, Patricia,” the chairman said, indicating a woman at the far end of the table who was then the secretary of the BBC.\\n\\nBBC vs Zara Mohammed: An exercise in Islamophobia Read More »\\n\\nThe lady in question was Patricia Hodgson. After a bit of humming and hawing, Hodgson replied that she thought it was the special assistant to the director-general. “Yes,” I said. “What is his name and what does he do?” Even though we had the top brass of the BBC around the table, no one seemed able to identify this individual.\\n\\n“Tell you what,” I said. “We’re only two floors up. Why don’t I just nip downstairs, knock on the door and ask?”\\n\\n“No, no, no, don’t do that,” the chairman said. “We’ll write.” After a bit of prompting, I received a letter indicating that Stonham had been succeeded by Michael Hodder, a former officer in the Royal Marines. Although I was assured that Hodder’s job description was very different from Stonham’s, it seemed remarkably similar. They were still at it, even though they had been caught red-handed.\\n\\nIn \\'safe\\' hands\\n\\nThe result of all this was that for most of the postwar era, the BBC remained in what the powers-that-be regarded as “safe” hands. It must be said that, within certain parameters and in comparison to most national newspapers, the standards of reporting at the BBC were high and slotted easily into the postwar consensus. Only as the consensus began to fray did cracks become visible.\\n\\nThe struggles between left and right in the Labour Party tended to be portrayed by most BBC commentators as being between “moderates” and “extremists”. There was also a tendency to downplay the size of demonstrations against nuclear weapons, and when such events were reported, the cameras would often focus on the banners of the tiny Communist Party contingent.\\n\\nIn the 1980s, when nuclear disarmament briefly became official Labour policy, it tended to be reported as “disarmament” - the word “nuclear” was usually missing. This was obviously deliberate, because it continued even though the misleading description was pointed out repeatedly.\\n\\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson leaves 10 Downing Street on 10 March 2021 (AFP)\\n\\nThe bitterly fought miners’ strike in the mid-1980s was another unfortunate episode. There was a good deal of violence and intimidation on both sides, but on the whole, only one side got reported - even though many of the police who flooded the pit villages of Yorkshire and the northeast behaved badly. In one particularly notorious incident at Orgreave in South Yorkshire, a veritable cavalry of mounted police officers launched an apparently unprovoked attack on picketing miners, and the BBC was caught reverse-editing its film to make it look as if the miners had first attacked the police, and not the other way round.\\n\\nThe resulting outcry meant that the mistake, if that is what it was, was quickly rectified - but among those who did not take the establishment view, it added to a general feeling that the BBC was not always to be trusted. Nor did it help that complaints tended to be brushed off with a smug response, the gist of which was usually: “We receive equal amounts of criticism from both sides, so we must have got it about right.”\\n\\nSignificant fallout\\n\\nIn 1986, I had my own little brush with BBC officialdom. In July that year, after months of meticulous research, I published a book suggesting that the wrong people had been convicted of the Birmingham pub bombings, at that time the biggest murder in British history. The book provoked considerable interest.\\n\\nMy publisher arranged a lengthy schedule of interviews with newspapers and broadcasting outlets, including BBC television news and Radio Four’s Today programme. Both were cancelled at the last minute. Later, I heard that an unseen hand had decreed that I was not a person of sufficient stature to be taken seriously. I duly wrote a letter to a national newspaper describing what had happened, and both interviews were swiftly reinstated.\\n\\nBy and large, however, the BBC’s worldview broadly matched that of the Conservative Party, and those in charge were generally regarded as “sound”. By and large, the Tories were content with the way things were. True, there had been a brief but significant fallout at the time of the 1956 Suez crisis over a decision by the BBC to award airtime to the leader of the Labour opposition, Hugh Gaitskell, to reply to the government’s version of events. Some Tories even went so far as to suggest that the government should take editorial control of the BBC, but Suez turned into such a debacle that the matter was soon forgotten.\\n\\nThe BBC stood its ground, but the seeds of what would eventually become widespread Tory dissatisfaction with the BBC had been sown\\n\\nIt was not until Thatcher that more serious tensions arose. Many Tory MPs were outraged by the BBC’s coverage of the 1982 Falklands War, which they deemed to be insufficiently patriotic. In 1985, BBC governors attempted to censor a documentary that included an interview with an IRA paramilitary. The programme was eventually broadcast, but not without a major row that led in due course to the sacking of the director-general, Alasdair Milne.\\n\\nIn 1986, Thatcher allowed then-US President Ronald Reagan to use bases in the UK to launch bombing raids against Libya in retaliation for an attack on a Berlin nightclub, in which two US servicemen had been killed and which was alleged to be the work of Libyan agents. Inevitably, civilians were killed - including, it was said, an adopted daughter of Libya’s leader, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi.\\n\\nThis was duly reported by the BBC correspondent on the spot, Kate Adie, causing the Tory party chairman, Norman Tebbit, to complain that the coverage was “riddled with inaccuracy, innuendo and imbalance”. The BBC stood its ground, but the seeds of what would eventually become widespread Tory dissatisfaction with the BBC had been sown.\\n\\nIraq dossier\\n\\nPerhaps the biggest bust-up of the postwar era between the government and the corporation, however, involved not the Tories, but Labour. In May 2003, BBC journalist Andrew Gilligan suggested that the government had “sexed up” its dossier on Iraq’s possession of weapons of mass destruction in order to boost its case for war. Two other BBC journalists reported similar claims.\\n\\nThe government hotly disputed this, but the BBC stuck to its guns, saying it had confidence in its source, who was eventually revealed to be a government scientist, David Kelly. Not long afterwards, Kelly was found dead in the woods near his home. A coroner’s court eventually returned a verdict of suicide. An official inquiry was set up under a senior judge, Lord Hutton. To widespread surprise, the Hutton report, published in January 2004, exonerated the government and resulted in the resignation of both the BBC chairman, Gavyn Davies, and the director-general, Greg Dyke.\\n\\nThe search for truth about Britain\\'s forgotten role in Iraq Read More »\\n\\nDamaging though this was to the BBC’s self-confidence, the fallout from the so-called “dodgy dossier” was not fatal. The Labour government had no interest in undermining the BBC, which on the whole remained a widely respected source of journalism in a media landscape that was becoming increasingly tabloid.\\n\\nIn the background, however, the war drums were beating. In addition to his four national newspapers, Rupert Murdoch had by now acquired a controlling interest in a satellite broadcaster, which by the early part of this century reached into almost 40 percent of households.\\n\\nThe rise of social media and the proliferation of channels made possible by digitalisation meant that the BBC’s natural customer base was rapidly eroding, especially among the young. In addition, the Murdoch press rarely lost an opportunity to bash the BBC for real and perceived failings.\\n\\nThe 2011 decision by the BBC to shelve an investigation into allegations of child abuse against entertainer Jimmy Savile was deeply damaging. Likewise, the unfounded allegation on BBC Two’s Newsnight that a prominent Conservative politician was involved in a child abuse scandal in north Wales provided yet more ammunition for those who wanted to see the corporation cut down to size.\\n\\nA narrative began to develop on the Tory right that the BBC was the preserve of a middle-class, London-centric, liberal elite who were out of touch with public sentiment on issues such as immigration and, above all, Brexit. These themes were increasingly taken up by the tabloid media, especially the Murdoch press.\\n\\nChanging licence fees\\n\\nThe first big blow was struck during negotiations between the corporation and the government over the renewal of the BBC’s charter, which takes place every 10 years. This is the one moment when the government has the whip-hand. In 2015, in a climate of austerity, Chancellor George Osborne insisted that the cost of free television licences for citizens aged 75 and over should in future come from the licence fee rather than the Treasury, even though it was the Treasury under Gordon Brown that took the original decision to grant the concession.\\n\\nHad Osborne wanted to rescind the concession, there was nothing to stop him from doing so, save that it might have damaged his party’s poll ratings among a section of the population that overwhelmingly votes Conservative. Instead, he chose to saddle the BBC with the liability at a cost of £750m ($1bn) a year - around a fifth of the corporation’s budget.\\n\\nPeople protest outside the BBC studios in London against the end of government funding for free TV licenses for those over 75 in June 2019 (AFP)\\n\\nThe BBC has since said that the exemption will apply only to the poorest pensioners, but even so, the cost is likely to be considerable. And that wasn’t all: Osborne also insisted that the corporation should bear 75 percent of the cost of the BBC World Service, which had hitherto always been a responsibility of the government, accountable to the Foreign Office. It was another large hit on the BBC’s budget.\\n\\nA programme of cuts is now well under way. Last July, it was announced that 450 jobs in regional news and current affairs were to go. Further job losses have been announced since, and more are in the pipeline. Overall, the corporation is aiming to cut budgets by £800m ($1.1bn). The impacts are already visible. BBC One schedules are becoming increasingly tabloid and infantile. News bulletins are increasingly insular. With rare exceptions - US elections, bushfires in Australia - most foreign news has disappeared from domestic bulletins.\\n\\nIn one sense, Covid-19 and Brexit have proved a godsend. Entire bulletins are consumed by these issues, to the exclusion of just about everything else. Forays outside the studio are becoming a rarity, except to conduct fatuous vox pops.\\n\\nReliable source\\n\\nThe impact of budget cuts on the World Service remains to be seen. In addition to English, the BBC broadcasts in 40 languages, and has long been for many people who live under oppressive regimes the most reliable source of information about what is going on in their own country. The late UN secretary-general, Kofi Annan, described the World Service as “Britain’s greatest gift to the world”.\\n\\nDuring the Vietnam War, my Vietnamese father-in-law listened nightly to the BBC Vietnamese service in preference to local media. Aung Sang Suu Kyi, the leader of Myanmar, described the BBC as her “lifeline” during many years of house arrest. Likewise, during the Arab Spring, the BBC Arabic service was a more reliable source of information than most regional outlets - even more so now that the uprisings have been suppressed.\\n\\nThe corporation\\'s reach would shrink dramatically and the plunge downmarket, already underway, would accelerate\\n\\nTo this day, the BBC remains one of the few sources of regular and accurate reporting from Yemen, and its recent documentary on the kidnapping and detention of the daughter of the ruler of Dubai was groundbreaking. Although sometimes accused of pro-Israel bias on that most controversial issue, the Israel-Palestine conflict, the sheer volume of complaints the BBC receives from the Zionist lobby suggests that it must be doing something right.\\n\\nSo far, the budget cuts have fallen mainly on the BBC’s domestic output. Some language services - notably those in Eastern Europe and the Balkans - have been discontinued, but new services have opened in Africa and the Far East. Investment in the Arabic service has actually increased. How long this can be sustained, given that three-quarters of the World Service budget now comes from the licence fee, is anyone’s guess - but at a time when Britain’s influence in the world is in decline, it is not in the government’s interests to let the World Service wither.\\n\\nLooming crisis\\n\\nOn the home front, however, a new crisis looms. Johnson is no friend of the BBC. During the 2019 election campaign, he described the licence fee as a tax that could no longer be justified. Ministers were ordered to boycott the Today programme. In September 2020, Tim Davie, a former Tory activist, was appointed director-general and has talked of reducing \"perceived left-wing bias\".\\n\\nOnce the election was out of the way, the gloves came off. In February 2020, the Sunday Times quoted a “senior” source as saying: “We are not bluffing on the licence fee. We are having a consultation and we will whack it. It has got to be a subscription model … The PM is firmly of the view that there needs to be serious reform. He is really strident on this.”\\n\\nBoris Johnson\\'s premiership is a calamity for Britain - and he knows it Read More »\\n\\nSo far, the government has confined its consultation to whether or not to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee - currently £157 ($219) a year per household - which could effectively make payment optional. An announcement is expected in the summer.\\n\\nIn truth, the licence fee is getting harder to justify amid the proliferation of outlets and the rise of streaming services such as Netflix, and the fact that the BBC no longer plays much part in the lives of many of the younger generation in the way that it once did in the lives of their parents. We may have reached a moment when political reality and the ambitions of little England ideologues coincide.\\n\\nThe future of the licence fee is a large cloud on the horizon. For some on the right, reducing the BBC to a subscription-only service, along the lines of PBS in the US, would be the Holy Grail. The corporation’s reach would shrink dramatically and the plunge downmarket, already underway, would accelerate. To paraphrase James Murdoch in his MacTaggart lecture, profit rather than standards would become the main driver of investment.\\n\\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.',\n",

              " 'From the \\'original sin\\' of 1917 to the government\\'s more recent adoption of the controversial IHRA antisemitism definition, Britain has always been firmly in Israel\\'s camp\\n\\nIn December 2016, then British Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative government formally adopted the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA)’s working definition of antisemitism. It was the first government in the world to do so, marking yet another milestone in the 100-year history of British support for Zionism and callous disregard for Palestinian rights.\\n\\nThe “original sin” was the 1917 Balfour Declaration, which promised to support the establishment of a “national home for the Jewish people”, provided that nothing was done to “prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine”. In 1917, Arabs constituted 90 percent of the population of Palestine; Jews made up less than 10 percent.\\n\\nThe declaration was thus a classic colonial document: it granted the right to national self-determination to a small minority, while denying it to the majority. To add insult to injury, the declaration referred to 90 percent of the country’s inhabitants as “non-Jewish communities in Palestine”, relegating them to an inferior status. Although grotesquely imbalanced in favour of Jews, the declaration at least included a promise to protect the civil and religious rights of Palestinians - but even this promise was never kept.\\n\\nPalestine was not lost in the late 1940s, as is commonly believed; it was lost in the late 1930s, as a result of Britain’s savage smashing of Palestinian resistance\\n\\nThe British mandate for Palestine lasted from 1920 until midnight on 14 May 1948, the date the State of Israel was proclaimed. The first high commissioner for Palestine, Herbert Samuel, was a Jew and an ardent Zionist. Partiality towards Jews was evident from day one; the cornerstone of the mandate was to deny representative institutions as long as Arabs were the majority in Palestine.\\n\\nIn the end, Britain over-fulfilled its promise to Zionists by helping the “national home” evolve into a Jewish state, while betraying its pledge to Palestinians. Britain’s betrayal gave rise to the Palestinian Great Revolt of 1936-39. This was a nationalist uprising, demanding Arab independence and an end to the policy of open-ended Jewish immigration and land purchases.\\n\\nThe revolt was suppressed with utter ruthlessness and brutality by the British army and police. Britain resorted to the entire panoply of colonial measures, including martial law, military courts, detention without trial, caning, flogging, torture, extra-judicial killings, collective punishment and aerial bombardment. Nearly 20,000 Palestinians were killed or wounded during the revolt, and villages were reduced to rubble.\\n\\nIn the process of crushing the uprising, Britain broke the backbone of the Palestinian national movement. British actions gravely weakened Palestinians and strengthened Zionists, as the two national movements moved inexorably towards a final showdown. Palestine was not lost in the late 1940s, as is commonly believed; it was lost in the late 1930s, as a result of Britain’s savage smashing of Palestinian resistance and support for Jewish paramilitary forces.\\n\\nAnti-Arab racism\\n\\nAn undercurrent of anti-Arab racism coloured Britain’s entire handling of the mandate for Palestine. In 1937, future British Prime Minister Winston Churchill said: “I do not agree that the dog in a manger has the final right to the manger even though he may have lain there for a very long time. I do not admit that right.\\n\\nThe raw truth about the UK\\'s special relationship with Israel Read More »\\n\\n“I do not admit, for instance, that a great wrong has been done to the Red Indians of America or the black people of Australia. I do not admit that a wrong has been done to these people by the fact that a stronger race, a higher-grade race, a more worldly-wise race … has come in and taken their place.”\\n\\nA Black Lives Matter protester had a point when, in June 2020, he sprayed graffiti on a Churchill statue in London’s Parliament Square to add the words “was a racist”. Churchill held Arabs in contempt as racially inferior. His description of Palestinian Arabs as a “dog in a manger” is shocking, but not entirely surprising; racism usually goes hand in hand with colonialism.\\n\\nAs the British mandate for Palestine approached its inglorious end, Britain persisted in its anti-Palestinian stance. When the United Nations voted in November 1947 to partition mandatory Palestine into two states, Britain adopted an official posture of neutrality. Behind the scenes, however, it worked to abort the birth of a Palestinian state.\\n\\nHaj Amin al-Husseini, the leader of the Palestinian national movement, fell out with Britain over its pro-Zionist policy in Palestine and made contact with Adolf Hitler during the Second World War. In British eyes, a Palestinian state was synonymous with a mufti state; accordingly, Britain’s hostility towards Palestinians and Palestinian statehood was a constant factor in its foreign policy from 1947-49.\\n\\nWiped off the map\\n\\nBritain gave a green light to its client, King Abdullah of Transjordan, to send his British-led little army into Palestine upon expiry of the British mandate, to capture the West Bank - which was intended to be the heartland of the Palestinian state. The winners in the war for Palestine were King Abdullah and the Zionist movement; the losers were Palestinians. Around 750,000 Palestinians, more than half the population, became refugees, and the name Palestine was wiped off the map.\\n\\nIn short, Britain played a significant but little-known part in the Nakba, the catastrophe that overwhelmed Palestinians in 1948. When Jordan formally annexed the West Bank in 1950, Britain and Pakistan were the only UN members to recognise it.\\n\\nMembers of the Haganah paramilitary escort Palestinians expelled from Haifa after Jewish forces took control in April 1948 (AFP)\\n\\nAgainst the backdrop of Black Lives Matter, the reassessment of Britain’s colonial past and the drive to decolonise school curricula, some scholars have leapt to the defence of the British Empire. Nigel Biggar, the Regius professor of theology at the University of Oxford, for example, defends the British Empire as a moral force for good.\\n\\nReferencing Cecil Rhodes and the campaign to remove his statue from Oriel College, Biggar conceded that Rhodes was an imperialist, “but British colonialism was not essentially racist, wasn’t essentially exploitative, and wasn’t essentially atrocious”. The British Empire’s record in Palestine, however, is rather difficult to reconcile with the benign view of the learned professor.\\n\\nShameful legacy\\n\\nThe Conservative Party and its leaders are the standard-bearers of this shameful legacy of unqualified British support for Israel and indifference to Palestinian rights. Conservative Friends of Israel (CFI) is by far the most powerful pro-Israel lobbying group in Britain, and its membership includes around 80 percent of Tory members of parliament. Since the May 2015 general election, CFI has sent 24 delegations with more than 180 Conservatives to visit Israel.\\n\\nThe last three leaders of the Conservative Party have been uncritical supporters of the State of Israel. Former Prime Minister David Cameron described himself as a “passionate friend” of Israel and insisted that nothing could break that friendship.\\n\\nBoris Johnson had the perfect opportunity to balance this with a recognition of Palestine as a state, but he repeatedly turned it down\\n\\nTheresa May was probably the most pro-Israeli leader in Europe during her premiership. In an address to CFI in 2016, she described Israel as a “remarkable country … a thriving democracy, a beacon of tolerance, an engine of enterprise, and an example to the rest of the world”. She spoke of Israel as “a country where people of all religions and sexualities are free and equal in the eyes of the law”.\\n\\nMay reserved her sharpest criticism for the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement, which works to end international support for Israel’s oppression of Palestinians and to pressure Israel to comply with international law. BDS is a non-violent, global grassroots campaign whose principal demands - the right of return of 1948 refugees, an end to occupation, and equal rights for Israel’s Palestinian citizens - are grounded in international law. This movement, May stated, “is wrong, it is unacceptable, and this party and this government will have no truck with those who subscribe to it”.\\n\\nMay reminded her audience that Britain was entering a “special time” - the centenary of the Balfour Declaration - and went on to deliver a wholly one-sided verdict on this colonial document: “It is one of the most important letters in history. It demonstrates Britain’s vital role in creating a homeland for the Jewish people. And it is an anniversary we will be marking with pride.” There was no mention of Britain’s failure to uphold even the minimal rights of Palestinians.\\n\\nNational rights\\n\\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has a slightly more nuanced take on Britain’s record as a colonial power in Palestine. In his 2014 book on Churchill, he described the Balfour Declaration as “bizarre”, “tragically incoherent” and an “exquisite piece of Foreign Office fudgerama”. This was one of the rare examples of sound judgement and historical insight on Johnson’s part. But in 2015, on a trip to Israel as mayor of London, Johnson hailed the Balfour Declaration as “a great thing”.\\n\\nThe Balfour Declaration: Enduring colonial criminality Read More »\\n\\nIn October 2017, in his capacity as foreign secretary, Johnson introduced a debate in the House of Commons on the Balfour Declaration. He repeated the mantra about Britain’s pride in the part it played in creating a Jewish state in Palestine. He had the perfect opportunity to balance this with a recognition of Palestine as a state, but he repeatedly turned it down, saying the time was not right. Since the Conservative Party supports a two-state solution, recognising Palestine would be a logical step towards that end.\\n\\nArthur Balfour, the foreign secretary in 1917, undertook to uphold the civil and religious rights of the native population of Palestine. A century later, the House of Commons added national rights as well, voting in October 2014 - by 274 votes to 12 - to recognise a Palestinian state. Cameron chose to ignore the non-binding vote; at least he was consistent in his passionate attachment to Israel, which is more than can be said about his successor. As with Johnson’s approach to any subject, in his attitude towards Palestinian rights, expediency prevails.\\n\\nAn unbroken thread of moral myopia, hypocrisy, double standards and skulduggery connects British policy on Palestine, from Balfour to Boris. The Conservative government’s adoption in 2016 of the IHRA’s non-legally-binding working definition of antisemitism falls squarely within this tradition of partisanship on behalf of Zionism and Israel, and disdain for Palestinians.\\n\\nThe definition states: “Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.”\\n\\nProblematic examples\\n\\nThe definition does not mention Israel by name, but no fewer than seven out of the 11 “illustrative examples” that follow concern Israel. They include “denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour”; “applying double standards by requiring of it a behaviour not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation”; “drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis”; and “holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel”.\\n\\nThere is no law against calling Israel an apartheid state, and progressive Israelis do so all the time\\n\\nThe 11 examples make a series of unwarranted assumptions about Israel and world Jewry. They assume that all Israelis adhere to the notion of Israel as a Jewish state; that Israel is a “democratic nation”; that Israel is not a racist endeavour; and that all Jews condemn the comparison between Israeli policy and that of the Nazis.\\n\\nIn fact, Israel is a highly heterogeneous and deeply divided society with a wide range of opinions on all these issues - and a political culture marked by fierce disputes and no-holds-barred debates.\\n\\nMany left-wing Israelis regard Israel as a racist endeavour. B’Tselem, the highly respected Israeli human rights organisation, issued a closely argued position paper in January titled “A regime of Jewish supremacy from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea: This is apartheid.”\\n\\nIt declared: “The entire area Israel controls between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea is governed by a single regime working to advance and perpetuate the supremacy of one group over another. By geographically, demographically and physically engineering space, the regime enables Jews to live in a contiguous area with full rights, including self-determination, while Palestinians live in separate units and enjoy fewer rights.”\\n\\nPeople participate in a protest organised by the Campaign Against Antisemitism outside Labour offices in London in 2018 (AFP/File photo)\\n\\nRight-wing Israelis continue to hotly deny that Israel is an apartheid state and reject any comparison with apartheid South Africa. But there is no law against calling Israel an apartheid state, and progressive Israelis do so all the time. Comparisons with Nazi Germany are also not proscribed by Israeli law. Such comparisons are less common in Israeli political discourse, but they are occasionally expressed in newspaper editorials and even by politicians.\\n\\nDevil in the details\\n\\nThe global Jewish community is just as diverse and disputatious. Ironically, to treat Jews as a homogeneous group is in fact an antisemitic trope. It is antisemites who fail to differentiate between different kinds of Jews, and want to see them all clustered in one place. It is on this basis that Theodor Herzl, the visionary of the Jewish state, predicted that “the antisemites will become our most dependable friends”.\\n\\nThe global Jewish community is just as diverse and disputatious. Ironically, to treat Jews as a homogeneous group is in fact an antisemitic trope\\n\\nThe devil is in the details or, in the case of the IHRA document, in the examples. Strictly speaking, there are two definitions: the two opening sentences, quoted above, and the list of 11 examples. This point cannot be emphasised strongly enough; it is a tale of two texts.\\n\\nTo achieve consensus on the document within the IHRA, it was necessary to separate the statement from the illustrative examples that followed. Pro-Israel partisans, however, have repeatedly conveyed the false impression that the examples are an integral part of the definition. They also habitually omit the qualifier that this is only a draft - a “working definition”.\\n\\nAs countless commentators, lawyers and scholars of antisemitism have pointed out, the IHRA working definition is poorly drafted, internally incoherent, hopelessly vague, vulnerable to political abuse, and altogether not fit for purpose. It does not fulfil the most elementary requirement of a definition, which is to define.\\n\\nThe definition states that “antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews”, but fails to spell out what this perception is. In my 50 years as a university teacher, I have not come across a more vacuous or useless definition. Yet, although it is vacuous, it is not innocuous. Kenneth Stern, the lead author of the definition, has rejected its adoption as a campus hate speech code, arguing that it “will harm not only pro-Palestinian advocates, but also Jewish students and faculty, and the academy itself”.\\n\\nAntisemitism vs anti-Zionism\\n\\nWhat the non-legally-binding IHRA document does do, with the help of the examples, is shift the focus from real antisemitism to the perfectly respectable and growing phenomenon of anti-Zionism. Anti-Zionism is sometimes described by pro-Israel stakeholders as “the new antisemitism”. It is essential, however, to distinguish clearly between the two.\\n\\nHow did antisemitism become conflated with anti-Zionism? Read More »\\n\\nAntisemitism may be simply defined as “hostility towards Jews because they are Jews”. Zionism, meanwhile, is a nationalist, political ideology that called for the creation of a Jewish state, and now supports the continued existence of Israel as such a state. Anti-Zionism is opposition to the exclusive character of the state of Israel and to Israeli policies, particularly its occupation of the West Bank. Antisemitism relates to Jews anywhere in the world; anti-Zionism relates only to Israel.\\n\\nThe IHRA document, taken as a whole, is susceptible to political abuse in that it makes it possible to conflate legitimate anti-Zionism with nefarious antisemitism. Israel’s energetic apologists, who were instrumental in promoting the document, conflate the two deliberately and routinely.\\n\\nTo criticise the definition for its vacuity is thus to miss a central point. In this endeavour, the definition’s very vagueness confers a political advantage. It enables Israel’s defenders to weaponise the definition, especially against left-wing opponents, and to portray what in most cases is valid criticism of Israeli behaviour as the vilification and delegitimisation of the State of Israel.\\n\\nDouble standards\\n\\nIsrael is not the victim of double standards. On the contrary, it is the beneficiary of western double standards. Under the IHRA examples, it is antisemitic to require of Israel a behaviour “not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation”. But this has nothing to do with anti-Jewish racism.\\n\\nUnder the IHRA examples, it is antisemitic to require of Israel a behaviour “not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation”. But this has nothing to do with anti-Jewish racism\\n\\nIn any case, Israel is not a democracy. Even within its original borders, it is a flawed democracy at best, because of discrimination at multiple levels against its Palestinian citizens. But in the whole area under its rule, including the occupied Palestinian territories, Israel is an ethnocracy - a political system in which one ethnic group dominates another.\\n\\nThe superior status of Jews in Israel is enshrined in the 2018 nation-state law, the official confirmation that Israel is an apartheid state. The law states that the right to exercise national self-determination in Israel is “unique to the Jewish people”. It establishes Hebrew as Israel’s official language, and downgrades Arabic - which is widely spoken by Arab citizens of Israel - to a “special status”.\\n\\nIsrael is the only member of the UN that enshrines its racism in law. It is therefore not antisemitic, but only right and proper, to expect Israel to behave like a democratic nation by giving equal rights to all its citizens.\\n\\nIsrael’s friends in the US and Europe have claimed for the definition an international status that it does not have. They pushed hard for the adoption of the definition by as many governments as possible, because it can be used to intimidate critics of Israel and pro-Palestinian campaigners by tarnishing them with the brush of antisemitism.\\n\\nAn Israeli flag flies in Jerusalem on 27 January 2020 (AFP/File photo)\\n\\nIn Britain, the top echelons of the Conservative Party have followed the Israel lobby’s lead. Indeed, in the Conservative Party as a whole, the IHRA document seems to have acquired the status of holy writ.\\n\\nDivisive consequences\\n\\nThe Labour Party discovered to its cost the divisive and damaging consequences of adopting this document. Initially, the party’s code of conduct incorporated five of the IHRA examples verbatim, and an additional two with minor amendments.\\n\\nThis did not satisfy Israel’s friends either inside or outside the party. The party was bullied by the Jewish Labour Movement, the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the Community Security Trust, and the Campaign Against Antisemitism to adopt all the examples verbatim. Not to adopt all the examples exactly as they stood, it was misleadingly argued, was tantamount to a rejection of the definition.\\n\\nIn the rush to burnish its pro-Zionist credentials, the Labour Party turned against some of its most progressive Jewish members\\n\\nLabour’s national executive committee caved in and abandoned its amendments to the remaining two examples. In the Orwellian world of the post-full-adoption Labour Party, many of the members who have been suspended or expelled for the crime of antisemitism were themselves Jewish. Several Jewish Labour Party members have been investigated since 2016, nearly all on the basis of allegations of antisemitism. This made a mockery of the claim of Keir Starmer, who succeeded the allegedly antisemitic Jeremy Corbyn as leader, to be making the Labour Party a safe place for Jews.\\n\\nUnder the new regime, the Labour Party is slavishly subservient to the benighted definition. A local Labour Party branch recently tried to submit a motion endorsing B’Tselem’s latest report on Israeli apartheid. It said: “This Branch supports the call from B’Tselem for an end to the apartheid regime to ‘ensure human rights, democracy, liberty and equality to all people, Palestinian and Israeli alike, living on the bit of land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea.’”\\n\\nThe motion was ruled out of order at the national level of the party on the grounds that, according to the IHRA’s working definition, this could be seen as designating Israel a “racist endeavour”.\\n\\nPolitically dangerous\\n\\nIn the rush to burnish its pro-Zionist credentials, the Labour Party turned against some of its most progressive Jewish members. Moshe Machover, the veteran Israeli British anti-Zionist, was expelled and then reinstated in 2017 after the Guardian published a letter of protest undersigned by 139 Labour Party members, including eminent Jewish lawyer Geoffrey Bindman, dismissing the insinuation of antisemitism as “personally offensive and politically dangerous”.\\n\\n\\'The wrong sort of Jew\\': How Labour pursued complaints against elderly Jewish opponents of Israel Read More »\\n\\nBut in 2020, Machover was suspended again. He received a 20-page letter from party bureaucrats containing a melange of old and new allegations of antisemitism, which Machover described as \"full of lies\" and part of a “Stalinist purge of the Labour Party”. He considered resigning and slamming the door behind him, but decided to give the party inquisitors a chance to further disgrace themselves by expelling him.\\n\\nThe real question is: why did the British government adopt this fundamentally flawed and deeply controversial document? The government cannot claim in self-defence that it had not been warned about the potentially harmful consequences of adoption.\\n\\nIt actually rejected calls from the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee to insert two “clarifications” to the IHRA definition and examples: firstly, to clarify that it is not antisemitic to criticise the government of Israel, without additional evidence to suggest antisemitic intent; and secondly, to clarify that \"it is not antisemitic to hold the Israeli government to the same standards as other liberal democracies, or to take a particular interest in the Israeli government’s policies or actions, without additional evidence to suggest antisemitic intent”.\\n\\nFunding threatened\\n\\nThe clearest clue that the present Conservative government is wedded to the IHRA definition as a means of curtailing debate and restricting free speech on Israel is contained in a letter from Gavin Williamson, the secretary of state for education, to university vice chancellors.\\n\\nBritish Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has pressed universities to adopt the IHRA definition (AFP/File photo)\\n\\nSent in October 2020 amid a national crisis of the education sector due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the letter noted that the number of universities that had adopted the IHRA definition remained “shamefully low”. The universities who ignored it were said to be letting down their staff and students, and their Jewish students in particular.\\n\\nBritish universities must stand firm against government\\'s \\'antisemitism\\' ultimatum Read More »\\n\\nThe education secretary insisted that these universities stop dragging their feet and formally endorse the IHRA definition. He threatened to cut off funding to universities at which antisemitic incidents occur and which had not signed up to the definition.\\n\\nWilliamson’s letter was not well received. He himself came across as authoritarian, while the tone of his missive was arrogant, hectoring and bullying. More worrying, however, was the content. It made no reference to any other form of bigotry, such as Islamophobia, homophobia or anti-Black racism. It did not escape notice that antisemitism was singled out for attention and punishment by a Conservative government that is renowned for its intensely relaxed attitude towards Islamophobia.\\n\\nThe letter assumed that universities that did not formally endorse the IHRA definition were not taking antisemitism seriously, which is far from being the case. It did not allow for the fact that most universities have rules and disciplinary procedures for combatting most forms of discrimination and racism, including antisemitism. Even if a specific definition of antisemitism is needed, which is debatable, no reason was given for privileging the IHRA one.\\n\\nAbove all, the letter, or rather the ultimatum, was seen as a threat to free speech, which universities and the Department for Education have a statutory duty to uphold.\\n\\nMinisterial diktat\\n\\nSome English universities openly, and courageously, rejected the IHRA definition; about a fifth capitulated to the ministerial diktat by signing up to the definition; and the majority chose not to commit themselves one way or the other. My own university, Oxford, has fixed its colours firmly to the fence.\\n\\nThe statement on its website reads: \"Oxford University aims to ensure that all students, whatever their background, have a fulfilling experience of higher education. To support us in our work, we have adopted (reflecting the position of the Office for Students) the IHRA definition of antisemitism as a guide to interpreting and understanding antisemitism, noting the clarifications recommended by the Home Affairs Select Committee. The IHRA definition does not affect the legal definition of racial discrimination, so does not change our approach to meeting our legal duties and responsibilities.\" In other words, Oxford will draw on the definition for intellectual enlightenment in thinking about antisemitism, but not as a guide for action.\\n\\nPalestinian voices are rarely heard in the national debate on antisemitism and Israel-Palestine\\n\\nIn a letter to the Guardian published in November 2020, a group of 122 Palestinian and Arab academics, journalists and intellectuals expressed their concerns about the IHRA definition. Palestinian voices are rarely heard in the national debate on antisemitism and Israel-Palestine. This letter is therefore worth quoting at some length for the light it sheds on Palestinian perceptions and positions:\\n\\n“In recent years, the fight against antisemitism has been increasingly instrumentalised by the Israeli government and its supporters in an effort to delegitimise the Palestinian cause and silence defenders of Palestinian rights. Diverting the necessary struggle against antisemitism to serve such an agenda threatens to debase this struggle and hence to discredit and weaken it.\\n\\n“Antisemitism must be debunked and combated. Regardless of pretence, no expression of hatred for Jews as Jews should be tolerated anywhere in the world. Antisemitism manifests itself in sweeping generalisations and stereotypes about Jews, regarding power and money in particular, along with conspiracy theories and Holocaust denial. We regard as legitimate and necessary the fight against such attitudes. We also believe that the lessons of the Holocaust as well as those of other genocides of modern times must be part of the education of new generations against all forms of racial prejudice and hatred.\\n\\n“The fight against antisemitism must, however, be approached in a principled manner, lest it defeat its purpose. Through ‘examples’ that it provides, the IHRA definition conflates Judaism with Zionism in assuming that all Jews are Zionists, and that the state of Israel in its current reality embodies the self-determination of all Jews. We profoundly disagree with this. The fight against antisemitism should not be turned into a stratagem to delegitimise the fight against the oppression of the Palestinians, the denial of their rights and the continued occupation of their land.”\\n\\nChilling effect\\n\\nThe British Society for Middle Eastern Studies (BRISMES), Britain’s leading academic organisation for the study of the Middle East and North Africa, issued a statement expressing its profound concern about the pressure applied on universities by the government to adopt the IHRA definition.\\n\\nIt said Williamson’s intervention would have a \"chilling effect\" on academic freedom and the university sector in Middle East studies and beyond. While welcoming steps to root out antisemitism and all forms of racism from university campuses, the association came to the conclusion that this particular definition would have a detrimental impact on researchers and students.\\n\\nLabour antisemitism: Why it has become impossible to criticise Israel Read More »\\n\\nAfter tracking the use of the IHRA definition in different contexts in the UK, it concluded that it was being deployed \"to use the false charge of antisemitism to silence and delegitimise those who support Palestinian rights\". The anti-racist working groups within universities with whom it had consulted were all vehemently against adopting the IHRA definition.\\n\\nThe statement ended by urging universities \"to protect academic freedom, to defend their autonomy against the government’s pressure to adopt the IHRA definition, and to retract the definition\" where it had been adopted.\\n\\nAnother call on universities to resist the government’s attempt to impose the IHRA definition came from an unexpected source: British academics who are also Israeli citizens. I am a member of this group, brought together by outrage at Williamson’s rude and crude intervention. It came as a surprise to discover that there are so many of us but, on the issue of his threat, we were all on the same page, regardless of our diverse academic disciplines, ages, statuses and political affiliations.\\n\\nAttacking free speech\\n\\nOur demarche took the form of a long letter sent in the last week of January to all vice chancellors of English universities and many academic senates. Since then, our letter has been signed by an impressive list of 110 supporters, all Israeli academics outside the UK, including many from Israel.\\n\\nWe tried to reach a wider public beyond the academy by publishing our letter in the mainstream media. Our request was either rejected or ignored by no less than 12 national newspapers and other media outlets. We were rather surprised and disappointed that not a single national paper saw fit to publish our letter or to report our initiative. But the letter was eventually published by the Jewish leftist online journal, Vashti.\\n\\nThe litany of rejections is in itself a comment on the reluctance of the mainstream media to give space to non-mainstream Jewish voices.\\n\\nThe Palestinian flag is waved during a protest in Tel Aviv over Israeli annexation on 6 June 2020 (AFP/File photo)\\n\\nIn our letter, we said: “Fighting antisemitism in all its forms is an absolute must. Yet the IHRA document is inherently flawed, and in ways that undermine this fight. In addition, it threatens free speech and academic freedom and constitutes an attack both on the Palestinian right to self-determination, and the struggle to democratise Israel.”\\n\\nWe also pointed out that the government’s pressure on higher education institutions to adopt a definition for only one sort of racism singles out people of Jewish descent as deserving greater protection than others who today endure equal or more grievous manifestations of racism and discrimination.\\n\\nStep in the wrong direction\\n\\nWe took strong exception to some of the “illustrations” of the IHRA document. Surely, we argued, it should be legitimate, not least in a university setting, to debate whether Israel, as a self-proclaimed Jewish state, is “a racist endeavour” or a “democratic nation”. We found it alarming that the document was being used to frame as antisemitic the struggle against Israel’s occupation and dispossession. No state should be shielded from such legitimate scholarly discussion, we opined, and nor should Israel.\\n\\nWe were rather surprised and disappointed that not a single national paper saw fit to publish our letter or to report our initiative\\n\\nOur letter went on to say that “as Israeli citizens settled in the UK, many of us of Jewish descent ... we demand that our voice, too, be heard: the IHRA document is a step in the wrong direction. It singles out the persecution of Jews; it inhibits free speech and academic freedom; it deprives Palestinians of a legitimate voice within the UK public space; and, finally, it inhibits us, as Israeli nationals, from exercising our democratic right to challenge our government\".\\n\\nIn conclusion, we joined in the demand that UK universities remain firm in their commitment to academic freedom and freedom of speech. We urged UK universities to continue their fight against all forms of racism, including antisemitism. We repeated that the flawed IHRA document does a disservice to these goals.\\n\\nWe therefore called on all academic senates in England to reject the governmental diktat to adopt it, or, where adopted already, to act to revoke it. A copy of our letter was sent to the secretary of state for education but, so far, we have not heard back from him. It would seem that all the protests about his letter are, for Mr. Williamson, like water off a duck’s back.\\n\\nThe case of Ken Loach\\n\\nA recent episode at Oxford highlighted the problematic implications of adopting or even semi-adopting the IHRA definition. Ken Loach - the multi-award-winning British filmmaker, lifelong anti-racist and social campaigner - was invited by his old Oxford college to a discussion that had nothing to do with Jews or Israel. This was advertised as a joint event between Torch, the Oxford Research Centre in the Humanities, and St Peter’s College.\\n\\nLoach was billed to discuss his filmmaking career with the master of St Peter’s College, Judith Buchanan, who is also a professor of literature and film. The event was part of a broader university humanities cultural programme that fosters debate between artists and academics.\\n\\nBritish universities must stand firm against government\\'s \\'antisemitism\\' ultimatum Read More »\\n\\nWhat followed was a well-orchestrated campaign of character assassination against a man who had spent his life championing the victims of oppression and discrimination, including Palestinians. Buchanan was bombarded with messages demanding she cancel the event.\\n\\nThe Oxford University Jewish Society said it was deeply disappointed by the decision to host the event because “on numerous occasions, Loach has made remarks that are antisemitic under the IHRA definition, which was recently adopted by the University of Oxford”.\\n\\nMarie van der Zyl, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, wrote to Buchanan, describing the decision to invite Loach to speak at her college as “entirely unacceptable”, and called for the event to be cancelled. She added that the board had been in touch with Jewish students at Oxford and “wholeheartedly support their condemnation of the event”. The categorical conclusion was: “This event should not take place.”\\n\\nCombined pressure\\n\\nThe Union of Jewish Students, a national organisation that represents around 8,500 students, piled on the pressure. “Just last summer”, it tweeted, “the University of Oxford stated they were committed to addressing systemic racism wherever it may be found, including within their own community. We do not see how this event can be reconciled with that statement. It is an outrage that St Peter’s College has ignored the concerns of its Jewish students and we urge Judith Buchanan, Master of St Peter’s College, to remove this speaker from the event. UJS are offering support to the Jewish Society.”\\n\\nBuchanan and Torch stood firm against the combined pressure from all Jewish quarters, and the event went ahead as planned. It was also streamed live on YouTube. The discussion was moderated by Professor Wes Williams, the director of Torch.\\n\\nFilm director Ken Loach waves during the Cannes Film Festival in 2019 (AFP)\\n\\nIn my inexpert opinion, it was a wonderful cultural event, a model of its kind. Loach showed clips from his films The Wind that Shakes the Barley (2006) about Ireland in the early 20th century and I, Daniel Blake (2016) about the inhumanity of the social benefits system.\\n\\nLoach talked about his films, and the worldview that informs them, eloquently and movingly in the discussion with Buchanan. There was no mention of Israel or Palestinians. After the webinar, Buchanan referred to the controversy surrounding it and stressed that neither the college nor the university believe in no-platforming. In an email, however, she apologised to Jewish students for the “hurt” caused by the row over the event.\\n\\nRehashed allegations\\n\\nThe day after the event took place, on 9 February, the student union of Wadham College held a meeting regarding St Peter’s College and Loach. It is unusual for the students of one college to criticise the conduct of another college, but the Jewish students at Wadham evidently felt strongly about this issue.\\n\\nThe motion before the meeting went into great detail about comments made by Loach on different occasions that were considered to be antisemitic and complicit in Holocaust denial. The document generated more heat and venom; it was essentially a rehash of old allegations that had been comprehensively refuted in the past. The motion was to formally condemn Buchanan and St Peter’s College in poorly handling the concerns of Jewish students. The censure motion was passed with 150 votes for, 14 against and four abstentions.\\n\\nThe Loach affair vividly demonstrates the damage that the IHRA document can do to free speech on campus\\n\\nLoach told the Telegraph, which reported on the controversy: “These recycled accusations are false and based on persistent misrepresentation and distortion.” The embattled filmmaker’s friends rallied to his defence. Some were members of Jewish Voice for Labour, which in the past had defended Corbyn against false charges of antisemitism.\\n\\nAt their request, I sent a statement to be read at the student union’s meeting at Wadham College. It read: “I deeply regret the attack by Wadham College students on Ken Loach. He has a strong and consistent record of opposing racism of every kind, including antisemitism. He is anti-Zionist but in no way antisemitic.\\n\\n“He is charged with having made comments that are antisemitic under the IHRA definition. But that definition is utterly flawed. Its real purpose is to conflate anti-Zionism with antisemitism in order to suppress legitimate criticisms of Israeli policies. Antisemitism is hostility towards Jews because they are Jews.\\n\\n\"Under this proper definition Ken Loach is completely innocent. He is also an admirable person, a champion of social justice, and an outstanding artist. The attack on him undermines freedom of speech and that has no place in an academic institution. I therefore urge the students of Wadham College to stop their vilification of Ken Loach and to accord to him the respect that he so richly deserves.”\\n\\nSmearing critics\\n\\nThe Loach affair vividly demonstrates the damage that the IHRA document can do to free speech on campus. The document was used to smear a prominent left-wing critic of Israel and a defender of Palestinian rights, and to try to deny him a platform.\\n\\nThe attempt at no-platforming ultimately failed, but it caused totally unwarranted pain to the artist, placed the master of his old college in an extremely awkward position, stirred up a great deal of ill-feeling on both sides of the argument, wasted a great deal of time and energy that could have been put to better use, and, worst of all, in my humble opinion, was completely unnecessary, unjustified and unproductive. All it did was sour the atmosphere around an imaginative cultural event.\\n\\nThe UK\\'s new anti-Semitism definition is more about protecting Israel than British Jews Read More »\\n\\nAre there any lessons to be learned from this sad episode in relation to the IHRA definition of antisemitism? First and foremost, it must be emphasised that antisemitism is not a fiction, as some people claim. It is a real problem at all levels of our society, including university campuses, and it needs to be confronted robustly wherever it rears its ugly head.\\n\\nSecondly, it would be quite wrong to suggest that Jewish students who protest about antisemitism are inventing or exaggerating their feeling of hurt. Jewish students genuinely feel vulnerable and have a real need for protection by university authorities against any manifestation of bigotry, harassment or discrimination.\\n\\nFighting racism\\n\\nThe real question is this: does the IHRA definition provide that protection? If the Loach affair is anything to go by, it most certainly does not.\\n\\nIn the first place, the definition is implicitly premised on Jewish exceptionalism - on the notion that Jews are a special case and must be treated as such. This gets in the way of solidarity and cooperation with other groups who are also susceptible to racial prejudice, such as Arabs and Muslims. To be effective, the fight against racism needs to take place across the board and not in isolated corners.\\n\\nAnother serious flaw of the IHRA definition is that, as I and many others have argued, so many of its examples are not about Jews, but about the State of Israel. As a result, it comes across as more concerned with the protection of Israel than the protection of Jews.\\n\\nIsraeli soldiers aim towards Palestinian protesters in the village of Kfar Qaddum, near Nablus in the occupied West Bank (AFP/File photo)\\n\\nIt is true that for many Jewish-British students, Israel forms a vital component of their identity. It is unhelpful, however, to let Israel feature so prominently in the analysis of antisemitism. Israel is a controversial country whose democratic institutions are being constantly eroded, and whose oppression of Palestinians attracts ever-increasing international censure - and, most recently, a ruling that paves the way for an investigation of war crimes by the International Criminal Court. Despite its claim to the contrary, Israel does not represent all Jews globally, but only its own citizens, a fifth of whom are Palestinian.\\n\\nBritish Jews are not collectively responsible for Israel’s conduct, but the IHRA definition implicates them in Israel’s affairs, and encourages them to target anyone they consider to be an enemy of the Jewish state.\\n\\nFurthermore, it bears repeating that criticisms of Israel are not necessarily antisemitic. The IHRA definition blurs the line between legitimate and illegitimate criticism. Nor does it protect Jewish students specifically; by aligning them too closely with Israel, it does the exact opposite. In the long term, therefore, it does not serve the interests of Jewish students.\\n\\nNo definition needed\\n\\nThe question arises, finally: do we need a definition of antisemitism at all? My own view is that we do not. The very term \"antisemitic\" is problematic because Arabs are Semites too. I prefer the term \"anti-Jewish racism\". What we need is a code of conduct to protect all minority groups, including Jews, against discrimination and harassment while protecting freedom of speech for all members of universities.\\n\\nThe universal right to freedom of expression is already embodied in UK law by the Human Rights Act of 1998, which prohibits public authorities from acting in a way that is incompatible with that right. Specific protection for freedom of expression in universities is provided by the 1986 Education Act.\\n\\nBritish Jews are not collectively responsible for Israel’s conduct, but the IHRA definition implicates them in Israel’s affairs\\n\\nWe do not therefore need any more legislation; all we need is common sense and honesty in applying the existing legislation. If a person attacks Israel, we should not ask whether the attack is antisemitic or not. And we should certainly not have to ask whether their statement falls foul of any of the seven Israel-focused IHRA illustrations of what might constitute antisemitism.\\n\\nWe should simply ask whether what they say about Israel is true or false. If true, the charge should be investigated further to ascertain whether the motive behind it is hostility or prejudice towards Jews and, if it is, appropriate action should be taken. And if the charge is false, it would be futile to speculate about the motives behind it. The debate about both anti-Jewish racism and Israel should be based on evidence, not on political or sectarian affiliations.\\n\\nThe essential point is that universities in the UK must have the autonomy to oversee and regulate all activities on their campuses, according to their own circumstances, free from external interference. Protecting freedom of speech on campuses is both a moral obligation and a legal duty.\\n\\nThe IHRA definition conflicts directly with this duty. I am old-fashioned enough to warm to the idea that a university is a pile of books and a community of scholars. In my kind of university, there is no room for colonial-style autocrats such as Williamson and his ilk.\\n\\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.',\n",

The mostly Muslim minority make up around 12 million people in the region. According to multiple reports, more than one million Uighurs are currently being held in internment camps across Xinjiang. Human Rights Watch said in September 2018 that up to 13 million Muslims in Xinjiang have been subjected to “forced political indoctrination, collective punishment, restrictions on movement and communications, heightened religious restrictions, and mass surveillance”. Uighur activists say that entire families have disappeared into the camps or been executed in what they describe as a “genocide”. China has repeatedly denied allegations that it is persecuting the minority group, instead describing the camps as “vocational training centres” designed to counter religious extremism. In January, the US State Department accused China of genocide in one of the Trump administration’s final acts. Other countries have condemned China but have stopped short of designating its actions as genocide. The United Nations defines genocide as acts “committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group” including: (a) Killing members of the group; (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; and (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.\\n\\n\"This is complicity in genocide,\" Abbas says categorically, adding: \"The US is also highly implicated in the genocide, but we have the democratic freedoms to allow dissenters and activists to demand action on these issues.\"\\n\\nAlthough Trump\\'s parting shot at China was welcomed by human rights activists as well as Uighurs themselves, they arrived during the frenetic last days of the Trump presidency, which were marked by allegations of the former president having encouraged an insurrection at his own government buildings, a refusal to accept election results and having the unenviable reputation of becoming the first head of state to be banned on social media for hate speech.\\n\\nFrom the start of his presidency, Trump pushed an \"America first\" agenda in both domestic and foreign policy, leaving no doubt that any pressure against China was driven by a determination to sideline the country\\'s biggest rival since the end of the Cold War.\\n\\nOn other matters of foreign policy, Trump presided over the controversial decision to move the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and facilitated a series of normalisation deals between Israel and Arab countries, which included coercing the likes of Sudan into recognising Israel in exchange for losing its terror designation.\\n\\nThe Trump administration recognised Morocco\\'s sovereignty over disputed Western Sahara, blocked attempts to stop sales to Saudi Arabia over its role in devastating Yemen, and defended Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman even after the horrific murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\\n\\n\"It is true that there were problems with Trump\\'s ideologies but then it is also true that his support for the Uighur cause helped us highlight the Chinese atrocities on Uighurs,\" Gulnaz Uighur, an activist now based in Europe, told MEE.\\n\\n\"Personally, when I compare the US response with the silence from Islamic nations, then I am not in a dilemma any more … millions of us are struggling,\" she said.\\n\\nUS, China and the \\'war on terror\\'\\n\\nIn 2013, Chinese President Xi Jinping launched a mammoth infrastructure project that would stretch from East Asia to Europe.

              " 'The sense of optimism that spurred on demonstrators on 14 February 2011 has been obliterated as foreign governments continue to acquiesce to a decade-long crackdown\\n\\nIn his recent book A Promised Land, former US president Barack Obama reflects on his time as leader of the free world at a moment when the Middle East was erupting in a cascade of demonstrations that would come to be known as the Arab Spring.\\n\\nIn the book, Obama discusses how he tried to ease Hosni Mubarak out of Egypt as the 2011 uprisings seemed poised to topple his administration, despite the autocrat\\'s well-established relationship with the US. After Mubarak\\'s removal, Obama notes that he was \"cautiously optimistic\" about the country\\'s future.\\n\\nWith two more countries engulfed by the Arab Spring, Libya and Syria, he was more forthright, launching or threatening to launch military interventions to remove their long-standing autocrats. In another, Yemen, he helped oversee a transition to remove another ailing administration.\\n\\nBut when it comes to the small Gulf kingdom of Bahrain, which despite its size had managed to grab headlines with mass demonstrations against the embattled Khalifa monarchy, Obama doesn\\'t split hairs about where the US stood.\\n\\n\"In concert with the Saudis and the Emiratis, the Bahraini regime was going to force us to make a choice, and all were aware that when push came to shove, we couldn\\'t afford to risk our strategic position in the Middle East by severing relations with three Gulf countries,\" he writes.\\n\\nThousands of anti-government protesters gather at Bahrain\\'s Pearl Roundabout in the capital, Manama, on 15 February 2011 (AFP)\\n\\nIn the 10 years since Bahrain was shaken by pro-democracy protests, the government has brutally crushed all dissent while the world powers have largely looked on and done nothing.\\n\\nThe 14 February \"Day of Rage\" that marked the beginning of the major country-wide demonstrations saw tens of thousands of people pour out onto the country\\'s streets calling for democratic reforms, an end to discrimination against the majority Shia Muslim population and, eventually, the end of the 245-year-old rule of the House of Khalifa.\\n\\nToday, the figures who led those protests and were hailed as the future of democracy in the Gulf are either in jail, silenced, in exile or dead.\\n\\nWhat had once been viewed as perhaps the most liberal and relatively pluralistic country in the Gulf is now described by campaigners as a \"police state\".\\n\\nA new report compiled by the London-based campaign group Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD), and shared with Middle East Eye ahead of its release for the 10th anniversary of the uprising on Monday, said that since 2011 at least 51 people have been sentenced to death in Bahrain.\\n\\nJust nine executions had been carried out between the independence of the state in 1971 and 2017, but six were carried out in the two-and-a-half years following that. Twenty-seven people are currently on death row in the kingdom, with 26 at risk of imminent execution.\\n\\nThere are thought to be around 4,000 political prisoners in the country\\'s heavily stretched jail system, while torture is rife.\\n\\nA leading Bahraini activist and lawyer, who has previously spent time in prison and asked for anonymity so as not to risk another sentence, told MEE that even the most modest criticisms were being ruthlessly stamped out in the kingdom.\\n\\n\"We can\\'t speak. You won\\'t find any single society or movement, or women\\'s association or trade or legal association, which can function inside Bahrain,\" he said.\\n\\n\"There is no society which can organise a single lecture or a single gathering or a conference for anything, except what the regime accepts.\"\\n\\nAlthough the activist said he wanted to continue speaking out openly about the injustices in Bahrain, he felt there was no possibility of doing so without facing prison time. \"I have to raise my kids,\" he explained.\\n\\n\\'We can\\'t speak.

Since Haji\\'s arrest in 2013, brutal ill-treatment has left him with partial deafness and permanent damage to his jaw and testicles, as well as a broken nose that has required two operations to fix.\\n\\n\"My experience of eight years of prison is maltreatment and physical and mental abuse as a form of punitive measures,\" he told MEE by phone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There is discrimination against political prisoners - the discrimination involves lack of proper healthcare, putting the lives of many political prisoners at great risk.\"\\n\\nTen years on, the situation for pro-democracy activists in the country can seem pretty grim, though the problems that sparked the original uprising have not gone away and privately anger is beginning to mount.\\n\\n\"We were asking for change, some positive change, after more than 240 years,\" said Haji. \"Now no one can talk, no freedom of speech - nothing.\"\\n\\n\\'Hope was at its peak\\'\\n\\nLike most Gulf states, money began pouring into Bahrain\\'s coffers after the discovery of oil in 1932, cash that over the next several decades would transform the economy and society of the kingdom, which had previously been primarily dedicated to pearl fishing.\\n\\nUnlike its neighbours, however, there were comparatively few attempts to bind the citizens of the kingdom to their rulers through the kind of rentier capitalism that the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar pursued.\\n\\nIn fact, the Khalifa family, who founded Bahrain in 1783, has been accused of existing in an antagonistic relationship with its subjects.\\n\\nAccording to academics Ala\\'a al-Shehabi and Marc Owen Jones in their 2015 book Bahrain\\'s Uprising: Resistance and Repression in the Gulf, the Khalifas have long cultivated a \"ruling core\" that allowed the family to engaged in a kleptocratic \"exclusionary politics\" with regards to the rest of the nation.\\n\\nAs Sunni Muslims and non-members of the majority Bahrana ethnic group, sectarianism has been seen as playing a pivotal role in the monarchy\\'s grip on power, and is believed to have contributed to widespread inequalities in wealth and power across the kingdom.\\n\\nWhile the other Gulf states were able to tamp down anti-government protests through a mixture of concessions and repression, Bahrain\\'s rulers found themselves sitting on top of a powder keg they couldn\\'t control. Eventually, their bigger neighbours Saudi Arabia and the UAE had to send their own security forces to the quell the 2011 uprising.\\n\\nBIRD\\'s director Sayed Alwadaei remembers the sense of optimism that pervaded the demonstrators, after seeing longtime rulers Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in Tunisia and Mubarak in Egypt being turfed out of power.\\n\\n\"This was the feeling throughout the Arab world - if it can be done in Tunisia, if Hosni Mubarak can fall within 18 days, maybe also the Khalifas. This is our golden opportunity,\" he recalled.\\n\\nAlwadaei was present \"from day one\" at the anti-government demonstrations and remembers a combination of hope and anger among the protesters, particularly in the wake of the killing of four demonstrators and the wounding of hundreds more by spooked security forces on 17 February.\\n\\n\"In 2011, optimism and hope were at their peak. There was no fear no matter how aggressively or harshly the government would resort to violence, people were determined,\" he said.\\n\\n\\'In 2011, optimism and hope were at their peak.

When the first 50 people took the roundabout, within a couple of hours we had thousands in that square.\"\\n\\nThe crackdown begins\\n\\nWhen the crackdown hit, it hit hard. According to some estimates as many as 100,000 people had gathered at the Pearl Roundabout by 23 February, roughly a sixth of the total citizenship of the country, making it the largest per capita demonstration of the Arab Spring.\\n\\nWith the Bahraini security services unable to contain the protests, Emirati and Saudi forces entered the country on 14 March and within a few days they had cleared the roundabout, at the cost of five lives and with hundreds wounded and arrested.\\n\\nWhat followed was a campaign of repression that has largely continued unabated up to the present day.\\n\\nAccording to the BIRD report, mass trials have become \"commonplace\" in the country, with 167 people sentenced in a single day in February 2019. Hundreds of activists have seen their citizenship stripped by the kingdom, with an estimated 300 currently denaturalised, including Alwadaei.\\n\\nIn 2020 alone, 10 death sentences were upheld by Bahrain\\'s highest Court of Cassation, including for four Bahrainis convicted on \"charges related to political unrest\".\\n\\nBahraini army tanks take position near Pearl Square in Manama on 17 February 2011 (AFP)\\n\\nMaryam al-Khawaja\\'s father, Abdulhadi, was one of the first high-profile arrests following the beginning of the demonstrations.\\n\\nPreviously president of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, he has now been in prison for just under 10 years, serving a life sentence for \"organising and managing a terrorist organisation,\" among other charges.\\n\\nSpeaking to MEE, his daughter said the family\\'s access to him was still highly sporadic.\\n\\n\"He does now have video calls because since January 2020 they\\'ve stopped all family visits under the reasoning of Covid-19.

So nothing is ever set in stone.\"\\n\\nKhawaja has herself become one of the most prominent voices internationally for the Bahraini democracy movement. It\\'s a profile that has forced her to live in exile due to a sentence she received in absentia for allegedly assaulting a police officer.\\n\\n\"What we see today is what you could call a stalemate, but it goes beyond that because it\\'s a situation that cannot continue the way that is it. There is absolute control over everything with regards to public space, access to freedoms and so on,\" she said.\\n\\nThe aftermath of the crackdown has seen Bahrain\\'s limited political plurality snuffed out. Al-Wefaq\\'s leader, Ali Salman, was arrested in December 2014 and later sentenced to life in prison. The organisation itself, previously tolerated by the monarchy, was officialy dissolved in 2016.\\n\\nEbrahim Sharif, who had gained prominence as one of the main non-Shia democracy activists, was also arrested and spent five years in prison. Waad was later banned in 2017 over suspected links to terrorism.\\n\\nNabeel Rajab, who co-founded the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights and is arguably the most well-known pro-democracy advocate in the country, was arrested numerous times in the wake of the protests.\\n\\nSpeaking to MEE in 2014, he said the world was coming to realise Bahrainis were \"living in a dictatorship in terms of laws, in terms of measures, all institutions\".\\n\\n\"It is very clear to the public opinion and international community that there is a country that discriminates and marginalises their indigenous population and does not have a system that respects human rights,\" he said.\\n\\nHe was later re-arrested and sentenced to two years in jail in 2017 for \"disseminating false news,\" and then five years in 2018 for \"offending national institutions\" and \"spreading rumours during wartime,\" in reference to Bahrain\\'s involvement in the war in Yemen.\\n\\nRajab has since been released from jail over concerns about the spread of Covid-19 in prisons.\\n\\nKhawaja said the authorities in Bahrain were still attempting to break prisoners\\' morale, including by removing books and writing materials, which she said was \"intellectual torture\" for her father.\\n\\n\"They\\'ve now allowed him access to some limited books, but not in the way he was before. So it\\'s an ongoing effort where they\\'re constantly trying to find new ways to break their morale or make life more difficult for them inside prison cells.\"\\n\\n\\'Steps in the right direction\\'\\n\\nIn an attempt to appease the demonstrators and present an image of reform to outside observers, the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry (BICI) was established by the king in June 2011.\\n\\nTaking in thousands of testimonies, the inquiry documented 46 deaths, 559 allegations of torture, and more than 4,000 examples of employees being sacked for taking part in demonstrations.\\n\\nThe US, UK and other foreign powers praised the government for carrying out the investigation and called for the swift implementation of the report\\'s recommendations, which included reform of the security services and the creation of bodies to hold police and the interior ministry accountable.\\n\\n\\'The US and UK\\'s support is the main reason behind the political stalemate in Bahrain\\' - Ali Hussain Haji, prisoner\\n\\nTen years on, though, few activists believe that any real reform has been carried out and many believe the BICI report was largely an attempt to allow the Bahraini government to maintain a cordial relationship with its foreign allies, who could point to a reform process when questioned about the kingdom\\'s rights record.\\n\\nKhawaja described the BICI as \"window dressing,\" pointing out that many of those whose cases of torture and abuse were listed in the report had received no change in status as a result of its publication.\\n\\n\"You have these cases with explicit detail of the physical, psychological and sexual torture these individuals were subjected to that was printed in a report that was accepted by the government - and a number of those individuals continue to serve life sentences,\" she said.\\n\\nMore than any other country, the UK has worked to protect Bahrain\\'s reputation overseas. In December 2014, the UK announced the establishment of a permanent naval base at Mina Salman port, which was opened in 2018.\\n\\nPhilip Hammond, then Britain\\'s foreign minister, described it as \"a watershed moment in the UK\\'s commitment to the region\" at the time of the initial announcement. That same month, Al-Wefaq\\'s Ali Salman was arrested in what Amnesty called \"an affront to freedom of expression\".\\n\\nAs recently as May 2020, the British government has promoted the idea that Bahrain has been carrying out reforms, with foreign office minister Tariq Ahmed stating in the House of Commons that the UK continued to \"believe that Bahrain is taking steps in the right direction to improve its human rights record, in line with the government\\'s plan, which built on the reform recommendations set out in the 2012 BICI report\".\\n\\nOnly two months later there would be international outcry over the proposed execution of two protesters, Mohamed Ramadhan and Hussain Ali Moosa, following trials that human rights groups said were tainted by allegations of torture.\\n\\nTorture allegations in the country are supposed to be investigated by two bodies, the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) and the interior minister\\'s ombudsman office, which have been described by the United Nations Committee Against Torture as ineffective and lacking independence. Both bodies received training and support from the UK.\\n\\nBritain\\'s then foreign secretary Philip Hammond (L) speaks with Bahrain\\'s Foreign Minister Khalid bin Ahmed al-Khalifa in Jeddah in 2016 (AFP)\\n\\n\"The US and UK\\'s support is the main reason behind the political stalemate in Bahrain,\" said Haji.\\n\\n\"They supported the heavy-handed security crackdown and as a result all of the human rights activists and political leaders have been detained, tortured and given heavy-handed sentences.\"\\n\\nKhawaja hopes Britain\\'s exit from the European Union will diminish its status and therefore its support for the Bahrain government.\\n\\n\"Having the UK leave the EU was a breath of fresh air for us, because the UK was extremely obstructive when it came to holding the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] accountable within the EU.

              " 'The Caliphate podcast has revealed again that the paper needs to confront unpleasant truths about how it handles stories at the nexus of Islam, the Middle East and terrorism\\n\\nOne of the most consequential US media scandals in recent years ultimately ended with a whimper. After a two-month internal investigation, the New York Times last month acknowledged that its blockbuster podcast, Caliphate, was based on a hoax.\\n\\nBut what should have been an assessment of the deep-seated problems that led to this debacle left major issues unaddressed - perhaps because they required facing too many unpleasant truths about how the paper has handled stories at the nexus of Islam, the Middle East and terrorism. Perhaps also because too many names on the newspaper’s masthead were implicated in Caliphate’s implosion.\\n\\nAt the core of the Times’ response were excuses, rather than a recognition of the systemic biases and blind spots in its coverage of Islam and the Middle East that caused the fiasco\\n\\nOn 18 December, the Times admitted that key parts of Caliphate fell short of its \"standards of accuracy” after it concluded that its key source, Shehroze Chaudhry, a 26-year-old Pakistani Canadian man, had fabricated his account of travelling to Syria and joining the Islamic State (IS).\\n\\nThe result of the internal investigation included a podcast episode, an editor’s note that now precedes Caliphate, a roundup by Times media reporters and an in-depth investigation into Chaudhry’s multiple deceptions. The lead reporter on the podcast, Rukmini Callimachi, whose star rose with her coverage of al-Qaeda and IS, was reassigned.\\n\\nYet, at the core of the Times’ response were excuses, rather than a recognition of the systemic biases and blind spots in its coverage of Islam and the Middle East that caused the fiasco. While it admitted that the problems with the podcast reflected an “institutional failure”, the Times did not apologise for the damaging role the hugely popular audio series had in shaping policy in Canada.\\n\\nWhen the podcast painted a picture of a murderous terrorist roaming the country’s streets, the opposition in Canada was furious. The political fallout effectively ended the debate over the repatriation of former IS members and their families. The lack of reckoning by the Times with the potential harm its false reporting caused raises questions about whether the newspaper\\'s primary concern was the damage to its reputation.\\n\\nThe Times concluded that there was not enough scrutiny of the reporting for the podcast because the newspaper was new to audio. But it’s clear the journalistic failings extended beyond the podcast. On the same day it made this statement, the Times appended editor’s notes to two of Callimachi’s articles from 2014 and 2019 after a review found significant problems.\\n\\nTerrorism hoax\\n\\nThe downfall of Caliphate began in September, when Canadian authorities charged Chaudhry with perpetrating a terrorism hoax based on interviews he gave to journalists, including the Times. Chaudhry, who went by the name Abu Huzayfah, was the main subject of Caliphate.\\n\\nAfter a lengthy investigation, Canadian authorities could not verify key parts of Chaudhry’s story. A Times investigation after his arrest reached the same conclusion. Chaudhry likely never went to Syria, joined IS or killed anyone, authorities say. He was charged on the grounds that his interviews sparked “public safety concerns amongst Canadians”. He is set to appear in an Ontario court later this month.\\n\\nNew York Times says Caliphate podcast probably made up by \\'con artist\\' Read More »\\n\\nEarly on in Caliphate, Callimachi expressed frustration that after interviewing a number of IS fighters over the years, she had never found someone willing to admit to their crimes. In Abu Huzayfah, she thought she had finally found that person.\\n\\nIt turns out that fear is an alluring and irresistible storyline. Caliphate had a narrative, with Callimachi and Abu Huzayfah playing starring roles. It was a narrative about gratuitous Muslim violence, to which Abu Huzayfah would finally give carnal details.\\n\\nIn an interview after the retraction, Times executive editor Dean Baquet acknowledged: “We fell in love with the fact that we had gotten a member of ISIS who would describe his life in the caliphate and would describe his crimes.” Callimachi and her audio producer, Andy Mills, pushed ahead with the podcast, despite knowing that Chaudhry made up key parts of his story. The allure of this narrative led the reporters to miss multiple red flags.\\n\\nFaulty timeline\\n\\nDuring their reporting, the team found that Chaudhry had lied about the timeline of when he travelled to Syria, but in response, they put together an alternate timeline that satisfied them. Despite discovering these deceptions before releasing Caliphate, they built an entire podcast around him anyway.\\n\\nThey relied on the word of two unnamed American intelligence officials who told them that Chaudhry was on the US no-fly list and had joined IS, but this should not have been used as evidence without further corroboration, as intelligence officials are not infallible.\\n\\nIn an interview about the Caliphate retraction, Baquet said the no-fly list was one of the reasons the Times was duped, explaining that it’s “not so easy to get on”, which is demonstrably untrue, with lawsuits alleging that babies and toddlers have been added to it.\\n\\nTimes reporter Rukmini Callimachi speaks in New York in August 2018 (AFP)\\n\\nIn an interview with a Canadian outlet a month after Caliphate\\'s release, Chaudhry denied that he had killed anyone. But Callimachi was convinced that she had caught Chaudhry in a special window of time before Canadian authorities were on to him.\\n\\nTwo and a half years later, shortly after Chaudhry’s arrest, Callimachi and the Times tried to claim that they had built “narrative tension” into the podcast, but that response fell flat, since the only doubt they sowed was about the timeline of when he went to Syria, not the substance of his account.\\n\\nAdditionally, Callimachi questioned whether Canadian authorities charged Chaudhry with perpetrating a hoax because they were unable to collect the necessary evidence to charge him. Such defensiveness is perhaps understandable from the lead reporter on a big story, but the Times’ period of introspection led to a response with multiple problems.\\n\\nThe \\'ISIS Files\\'\\n\\nThere was a backlash against Callimachi and the Times in 2018 after she took more than 15,000 internal IS documents out of Iraq without permission from Iraqi authorities, which the newspaper later published as the “ISIS Files”. The documents were also featured throughout Caliphate. She and the Times were criticised for not redacting some of the documents to protect Iraqis’ names and personal information, including that of minors.\\n\\nCallimachi’s decision to take these documents out of the country raised legal questions about the ethics of removing important historical documents from a war-torn country. But the problems went beyond Caliphate and some of Callimachi’s colleagues have said that their attempts to warn their managers were futile.\\n\\nThe Caliphate podcast overemphasises religious ideology, while stripping the group\\'s founding and rise from the geopolitical context of Iraq\\n\\nA Syrian journalist who helped to report a story for Callimachi that was published in 2014 (one of the articles recently corrected) said his warnings about the credibility of a source she relied on were dismissed. “With Rukmini, it felt like the story was pre-reported in her head and she was looking for someone to tell her what she already believed, what she thought would be a great story,” Karam Shoumali told the Times.\\n\\nAs the Washington Post’s Erik Wemple reported, another colleague reportedly told editors at a meeting to discuss the Caliphate retraction: \"You discouraged people from using the fire alarm, and when some of us did use the fire alarm anyhow, we found the alarm was not connected to anything.\"\\n\\nFor her part, Callimachi released a statement on the day of Caliphate’s retraction saying: \"I am fiercely proud of the stories I have broken on ISIS and its crimes against humanity,\" and apologised for \"what we missed and what we got wrong.\"\\n\\nI am fiercely proud of the stories I have broken on the ISIS beat. But as journalists, we demand transparency from our sources, so we should expect it from ourselves. Please see my full statement below regarding our Caliphate podcast: pic.twitter.com/FBUFsrnbsa — Rukmini Callimachi (@rcallimachi) December 18, 2020\\n\\nThe Caliphate implosion and Callimachi’s track record draw attention to a double standard in journalistic rigour and professionalism when it comes to covering the Middle East and the terrorism beat.\\n\\nAfter the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting, Callimachi recklessly speculated, based on unverified claims in IS publications, about the possibility that the shooter, Stephen Paddock, had converted to Islam and carried out the shooting at the behest of IS. That she was allowed to baselessly speculate on social media demonstrates that professional standards often don’t apply when it comes to the terrorism beat.\\n\\nLazy stereotyping\\n\\nIn a revealing answer for a Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything) in which Mills and Callimachi participated after the release of the podcast, Mills was asked to name the biggest misconception concerning IS. He responded that in the West, it was “that belief and religion play no role”.\\n\\nHas the New York Times declared war on Iran? Read More »\\n\\nI’m not sure what “West” he was referring to. Has there not been extensive public discussion of the various “problems” with Islam, Muslims and the Muslim world since 9/11? One of the two great US parties has made massive political hay for years by repeating ad nauseum, publicly and provocatively, that “we” need to name the problem: “radical Islamic terrorism”.\\n\\nCallimachi’s reporting on IS fed and fed off of this prurient fascination with “Islam and violence”. The Caliphate podcast overemphasises religious ideology, while stripping the group’s founding and rise from the geopolitical context of Iraq, a country that was destroyed by the 2003 US invasion and occupation, which destabilised the entire region.\\n\\nA leitmotif of Callimachi’s work is that IS and other jihadist groups are a legitimate - and perhaps revealing - manifestation of Islam. By Callimachi’s count, 40,000 Muslim foreigners joined IS, which in a religion of 1.8 billion is a statistically insignificant number. Yet, she devotes much of her reporting on the group to describing, explaining and at times acting as a borderline stenographer for what amounts to a murderous cult’s theological beliefs and justifications.\\n\\nThe lazy stereotyping allowed when reporting on “the region”, identified decades ago by Edward Said, rears its head in Callimachi’s analysis (as well as those of too many other major reporters). In an interview with NPR in 2015, she said that parents supporting their daughters who were raped was unusual in the Middle East, or “this part of the world”. What evidence is there of this? Maybe she could speak to the Iraqi families whose daughters were raped by American soldiers to see whether they support their daughters.\\n\\nSensationalistic reporting about the Middle East “often confirms readers’ worst biases” (AA)\\n\\nEven if Callimachi wanted to, however, she would not be able to. Although much of her most high-profile work is based on Arabic-language documents, Callimachi does not speak or read Arabic.\\n\\nThis dismissive attitude towards the region is typical: wringing hands over its cultural backwardness and placing its majority religion at the centre of discussions on violence, instead of asking what happens to people subjected to decades of sanctions, oppression, occupation and the destructive power of the US military. This trope in journalism is so ingrained that most people don’t even notice it.\\n\\nA study in contrasts\\n\\nIn the editor’s note preceding the Caliphate podcast, there’s no mention of the word “retract”. Given how much Abu Huzayfah’s story figured into the podcast, it is a strange decision not to use this word when the tainted character is mentioned in all but one episode (the ninth chapter, which itself raises ethical questions, as when Callimachi asked a Yazidi girl to participate in a call with her alleged rapist to confirm his voice. Would this tactic be acceptable in the US on such a sensitive story involving minors?)\\n\\nWe\\'ve been here before. In the lead-up to the Iraq War, the Times laundered unverified propaganda from Iraqi opposition members and US intelligence and placed it prominently on the front page\\n\\nThe lack of a clear retraction stands in stark contrast to other journalistic case studies, including the Atlantic’s recent retraction of a long read about wealthy Connecticut parents trying to ensure their kids’ admission into elite universities through niche sports. After the Atlantic discovered that the author, who had a history of plagiarism two decades earlier, had fabricated key details or made mistakes that needed correcting, the magazine retracted the piece and said it could not stand by it.\\n\\nIn contrast, the Times called Callimachi a “powerful reporter”, though the damage her podcast caused is undeniably greater than any fallout from the Atlantic article.\\n\\nThe most the Times seems willing to do is reassign Callimachi, even though she had already begun reporting on stories beyond the terror beat before the podcast’s implosion, including a high-profile deep dive into Breonna Taylor’s death in Louisville during a police raid in March 2020.\\n\\nIn the fallout over the Caliphate saga, the Times returned the Peabody Award it won for the podcast and withdrew its entry for the Pulitzer Prize from consideration (it had been given a “finalist” citation).\\n\\nWill it happen again?\\n\\nReporting about Arabs, Muslims and the Middle East, especially sensationalistic stories, is believed because it often confirms readers’ worst biases and pre-existing beliefs. We have become so inured to framing that pathologises Arabs and Muslims that we don’t even notice it. But there’s also a fear to publicly critique a reporter from a hallowed institution, which explains why the Times not only gets away with such framing time and again, but seems to encourage it from its biggest stars.\\n\\nNew York Times sends a simplistic message on regional uprisings: Blame Iran Read More »\\n\\nWe’ve been here before. In the lead-up to the Iraq War, the Times laundered unverified propaganda from Iraqi opposition members and US intelligence and placed it prominently on the front page of the newspaper, helping to sway public opinion in favour of the war.\\n\\nIn its tepid apology for such reporting in May 2004, the Times wrote: “But we have found a number of instances of coverage that was not as rigorous as it should have been. In some cases, information that was controversial then, and seems questionable now, was insufficiently qualified or allowed to stand unchallenged. Looking back, we wish we had been more aggressive in re-examining the claims as new evidence emerged - or failed to emerge.”\\n\\nIt seems like the Times has once again failed to take away the right lessons from this debacle, which means it can - and likely will - happen again.\\n\\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.',\n",

Now the televangelist has been sentenced to 1,000 years in prison, and leaves a legacy of abuse in his wake\\n\\nIn the end, it was not the British deep state, Darwinists, Jews, Freemasons or any of the sinister cabals that Adnan Oktar long railed against that defeated him. It was the Turkish judiciary.\\n\\nOn Monday, the notorious 64-year-old preacher, often referred to in salacious headlines as a \"sex cult leader,\" was sentenced to 1,075 years in jail for crimes including sexual assault, sexual abuse of minors, fraud, and attempted political and military espionage.\\n\\nIt marks the end of a long and bizarre career for the preacher, television host, author and filmmaker.\\n\\nBeginning his career in the 80s as a firebrand orator, railing against Jews, Freemasons and Charles Darwin, he later became (in)famous for his shows on Turkish TV, in which he would discuss Islamic principles while scantily clad women with bleached blonde hair danced around him to popular music. These women Oktar referred to as his \"kittens\".\\n\\nAdnan Oktar and his \\'kittens\\' (Global Ltd)\\n\\nHe perhaps gained the most fame worldwide for his numerous texts denouncing evolution and for being one of the first Muslim thinkers to import Christian evangelical Creationism into Islamic circles. Under the pen name Harun Yahya, his book Atlas of Creation, an 800-page tome that purports to debunk evolution, has been sent out unsolicited around the world, and managed to have some success in spreading Creationist ideas beyond a purely Christian fundamentalist audience.\\n\\nBut behind the oft-mocked public face of Oktar\\'s organisation was a sinister world of sexual abuse and cult-like coercion. Speaking in his defence in court, Oktar claimed to have \"close to 1,000 girlfriends\". He denied abusing them, instead describing himself as having an \"overflowing of love for women\".\\n\\nBy contrast, one of the women speaking (anonymously) at his trial said Oktar had sexually assaulted her and other women, often forcing them to take contraceptive pills. Around 69,000 contraceptive pills were found in his home, which he claimed in court were used to treat skin disorders and menstrual problems.\\n\\nHis behaviour has landed him in jail on numerous occasions, but now sentenced to more than a millennium in jail, it seems like the page might finally be closing on Adnan Oktar\\'s story.\\n\\nEdip Yuksel, a religious scholar and activist who was a colleague of Oktar\\'s in the 80s, said his imprisonment was well deserved after decades of crimes in his \"crazy cult\".\\n\\n\"He\\'s an evil person who destroyed many lives of very bright young men with great potential,\" he told Middle East Eye.\\n\\n\\'If you shot it as a movie, they would say it\\'s too exaggerated \\'\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Ebru Simsek, a former member of Oktar\\'s organisation who claimed she was subjected to abuse, told Turkish media that she was happy that justice had been done.\\n\\nShe recalled Oktar first coming across her after seeing her in a beauty contest on TV in 1994.\\n\\n\"Adnan Oktar saw me on the screen and went crazy! He even said, \\'I saw you in the newspaper, on TV, I liked it very much, take your pajamas and live with me in my wonderful mansion\\',\" she told Posta.\\n\\n\"\\'Come here, I will offer you the best conditions, you will wear the best brands, your life will be luxurious\\'. I felt that they had nothing to do with religion.\"\\n\\nAfter leaving his group, she later found herself subjected to more than 300 defamation lawsuits from Oktar, who she said was \"obsessed\" with her. The pressure applied on Simsek eventually became so much, disrupting both her work and social life, that she left for the United States to escape his harassment.\\n\\n\"If you shot it as a movie, they would say it\\'s too exaggerated, they wouldn\\'t watch it,\" she said of the whole ordeal.\\n\\nAccording to The Mahdi Wears Armani, so far perhaps the only major academic work focusing on Oktar and his movement, he grew up in a relatively affluent secular family in the 70s, only really becoming involved in religious activism after moving to Istanbul to study at what was then the Academy of Fine Arts in 1979.\\n\\nOver the 80s he would build a circle of devotees known as Adnancilar (Adnanists), who were followers of the influential Kurdish Muslim scholar Said Nursi. Nursi advocated the marrying of traditional Islamic beliefs with scientific ideas and would eventually be one of the leading figures in the Republic of Turkey\\'s Islamic revival movement.\\n\\n\\'It was a complete cult, all the criteria of a cult as you would define it today, it was there: isolation, entire control of the lives of the cult members\\' - Edip Yuksel, former associate\\n\\nBy far the most influential follower of Nursi was cleric Fethullah Gulen, whose own \"modernist\" Islamic movement would become one of the world\\'s largest, before being utterly crushed after falling out with the Turkish government in 2013 and then later being blamed for a 2016 coup attempt. Among the charges levelled at Oktar at his trial was that he had links to Gulen\\'s movement, something that he has denied.\\n\\n\"Oktar was influenced by the Islamic modernism of the Turkish scholar Said Nursi, and often cites Nursi in his writings, but he was never officially embraced, neither by the neo-Nurcu Gulen movement, nor the more traditional Nurcu groups in Turkey,\" Anne Ross Solberg, author of The Mahdi Wears Armani, told MEE.\\n\\n\"Oktar has always claimed to represent traditional Sunni Islam, but has never been accepted as a Muslim authority in Turkey - he is an interior designer and has no formal religious training.\"\\n\\nIn 1986, Oktar was arrested on charges of \"making propaganda with the aim of weakening or destroying national sentiments,\" and eventually found himself in the criminal ward at Bakirkoy Hospital, where he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.\\n\\nYuksel first met Oktar that same year. Around that time, Yuksel said he had begun formulating many of his ideas around what is now generally referred to as Quranism - a strand of Islamic thinking that rejects both Sunni and Shia Islam, citing only the Quran itself as a source of religious doctrine.\\n\\nYuksel says he acted as a \"mentor\" to Oktar, whom he considered a kindred spirit.\\n\\nAdnan Oktar, photographed with actor Ahu Tugba in 1989 (Savas Kalafat)\\n\\n\"I was interested in some of the interviews with him, and I said to him \\'I would like to meet you\\'. I wanted to convert him to my current position on monotheism, rejecting the Sunni and Shia religions,\" he said.\\n\\nHe said that Oktar had initially been \"very receptive\" to his ideas, and that after several discussions he told Yuksel that he agreed with his Quranist ideas and the rejection of the two main Islamic strains.\\n\\nBut after a while, Yuksel said, he began to get suspicious of Oktar\\'s sincerity and the \"cult\" developing around him, to whom Oktar would often pass off many of Yuksel\\'s ideas as his own.\\n\\nFormer members of Oktar\\'s group would later come to Yuksel and talk about life in the organisation.\\n\\n\"They would be in touch with me and talk about the crimes he was committing, a lot of sexual crimes. Of course it was a complete cult, all the criteria of a cult as you would define it today, it was there: isolation, entire control of the lives of the cult members,\" he said.\\n\\nAtlas of Creation\\n\\nIn the 90s, Oktar\\'s group formalised their activities, founding the Science Research Foundation (BAV).\\n\\nThey traded overtly Islamic garments for designer clothing and proclaimed themselves supporters of the ideals of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the secularist founder of modern Turkey.\\n\\nThey also turned their focus onto a new foe: Charles Darwin.\\n\\nIn 2007, Oktar went global with the publication of Atlas of Creation, which purported to scientifically debunk the English naturalist\\'s theory of evolution.\\n\\nOktar distributed tens of thousands of copies of the book to schools, researchers and universities across Europe and the US. The New York Times described it as causing a \"stir\" in France, where creationist literature had been hitherto fairly rare.\\n\\nA copy of the book even made its way onto the shelf of European Central Bank president Christine Legarde:\\n\\nSpot the owl pic.twitter.com/EC70E5ZSDO — Carolynn Look (@carolynnlook) June 26, 2020\\n\\nMany have pointed out that Atlas of Creation fails to pass even the most basic scientific scrutiny.\\n\\nGeneticist and writer Adam Rutherford wrote in 2009 that the book, which claims to prove that no species alive on Earth today underwent mutagenesis, was reflective of a \"whole different flavour of stupid\".\\n\\n\"Page 244 has a picture of a caddis fly, with a legend that asserts - as virtually every page does - that the beast in question has always existed in its current form as demonstrated by a vaguely similar looking fossil, therefore evolution is bunk,\" he wrote.\\n\\n\"Except it\\'s not a caddis fly, it\\'s a fishing lure, beautifully crafted by master tier Graham Owen, with the clearly visible hook piercing the man-made abdomen. Other exquisite examples of Owen\\'s work also appear in the Atlas.\"\\n\\nOktar would later offer a 10 trillion lira ($6.6tn at the time) reward to anyone who could disprove the book\\'s premise. So far he is yet to pay out.\\n\\nKittens\\n\\nIn 2011, Oktar founded a TV station, A9 TV, which broadcast both over the internet and on Turkish cable networks.\\n\\nThe channel, apart from hosting a number of documentaries based on Oktar\\'s works, would become his main platform for broadcasting the preacher\\'s unique brand of televangelism.\\n\\nMuslim televangelists had been around for many years and were nothing new, but Oktar\\'s method of presentation certainly was.\\n\\nHis shows featured a host of young women, who would discuss current affairs and religious issues with Oktar, as well as dancing to pop music in between segments. It was certainly unprecedented in the world of Islamic televangelism.\\n\\nOktar repeatedly used Islamic justifications for the unusual appearance of his co-hosts, who seemed dressed for the nightclub rather than a religious sermon. Dispensing with \"modest\" clothing didn\\'t make them any less Muslim, he said.\\n\\nYuksel said this was one of the principles Oktar purloined from him in the 80s.\\n\\n\"At that time I said that the headscarf doesn\\'t exist in the Quran. I made a very powerful argument based on the verses of the Quran... for Islamists in Turkey, half of their religion is about the hair of women,\" he explained.\\n\\n\"Afterwards [Oktar] used this argument, but abused it to make a sex cult. This created very bad associations for the cause of reformation.\"\\n\\nThroughout the shows, Oktar, who was himself clad in expensive designer clothing rather than a clerical outfit, would regularly compliment the women, who he labelled his \"kittens\".\\n\\nJournalist Meher Ahmad travelled to Oktar\\'s headquarters in Istanbul in 2015 to make a film for Vice after spending several months talking online to one of Oktar\\'s female supporters, Ebru Altan.\\n\\nShe told MEE that her initial intention had been to interview the women in Oktar\\'s group about feminism in Islam, but when she arrived she found herself repeatedly stonewalled and treated with suspicion.\\n\\n\"They wouldn\\'t let us use our cameras, they said, \\'Oh that\\'s a no go for us. You can\\'t use your cameras, you have to use our cameras\\',\" she said, adding that they were of a considerably lower quality than Vice\\'s own and ended up making the film look like a \"porno from the 80s\".\\n\\n\"They kept saying to me, \\'Oh you\\'ll get to talk to the women later, you\\'ll get to talk to the women later,\\' because that was what we were there for, we were less interested in the organisation than in a one-on-one interview or a group interview with the women.\"\\n\\nHer team was then taken on a tour of a number of properties owned by Oktar\\'s organisation. One house on the Bosphorus, she said, looked like a \"reality TV set\" and was adorned with Versace pillows and satin bedsheets and had bedrooms with mirrors on the ceiling.\\n\\nEventually, after a tour that involved explanations of Oktar\\'s theories on Creationism, Ahmad was told the only opportunity they would have to speak to the women would be live on his show.\\n\\nA visibly uncomfortable Ahmad can be seen sitting in a small audience as Oktar explains his views to her on the position of women in Islam.\\n\\nHalfway through the broadcast, the audience, by this point primarily composed of \"kittens,\" take a break to dance in their chairs to Sia\\'s Chandelier.\\n\\n\"It was the first time I\\'d seen Ebru in person, but it was such a controlled environment because we were on TV, so I couldn\\'t just turn and start asking them questions. It was very uncomfortable,\" said Ahmad.\\n\\nMeher Ahmad sitting with Adnan Oktar\\'s \"kittens\" on the set of his TV show (Meher Ahmad)\\n\\nAfter asking permission from Oktar, she was able to ask a number of questions of the women, though only Ebru responded.\\n\\n\"As soon as the show ended they paraded away, I didn\\'t even get a chance to shake their hands afterwards... it was super bizarre and that was my last interaction with them,\" she recalled.\\n\\n\"We were hoodwinked in a way, we agreed to these interviews with them and they said it was OK and they knew we were bringing camera people, but when we arrived it was like this moving target of, \\'Oh you\\'ll talk to them later, oh you\\'ll get to do this later\\'.\"\\n\\nAhmad said Oktar\\'s organisation had attempted to portray an image of the women involved as empowered and independent, but that her experience suggested this was not the case.\\n\\n\"I did go into it thinking there is something untoward happening, and we kept looking for opportunities to ask people what\\'s going on, only to be pushed further and further away from the women themselves.\"\\n\\nFrom Holocaust denier to Third Temple supporter\\n\\nAnother area in which Oktar dabbled was the interfaith dialogue scene. From the 90s onwards, he cultivated links with Christian Creationists as part of his anti-Darwin crusade. More surprising, however, was his building of links with right-wing Israelis in the 21st century.\\n\\nOne of the first publications by BAV, in 1996, was The Holocaust Deception, which denied that the Nazis had a plan for the mass extermination of Jews and was largely a continuation of his antisemitic conspiracy-theorising dating back to the 1980s.\\n\\nTen years later, though, there had been a complete change of tune: in 2006 BAV published a book called The Holocaust Violence, which acknowledged the genocide. A year later, he denied even having written the original Holocaust-denying book.\\n\\nTurkish preacher and creationist Adnan Oktar (L) shakes hand with Israeli settler Rabbi Yehuda Glick in Istanbul on 2 July 2015 (A9TV)\\n\\nNow, far from espousing the view that Jews had a scheme to \"erode the spiritual, religious, and moral values of the Turkish people and make them like animals\", he could be seen attending numerous events in Israel, being pictured with far-right Zionists like Yehuda Glick and Rabbi Meir Lau, as well as making appearances and writing columns in Israeli media outlets calling for unity.\\n\\nPerhaps the main reason he was able to court these figures was his vocal support for allowing Jews to pray in the Al-Aqsa compound, the area in occupied East Jerusalem\\'s Old City where the First and Second Jewish Temple are believed to have stood. Some far-right Israeli settlers wish to build a Third Temple on the site, replacing the Al-Aqsa Mosque and Dome of the Rock shrine.\\n\\nKnown to Muslims as the Haram al-Sharif and seized by Israel in 1967 war, the idea of allowing Jewish settlers to pray on one of the holiest sites in Islam is anathema to most Muslim scholars and Palestinian activists.\\n\\nFor Oktar, however, \"the protests by some Muslims against Jews worshipping there are in no way compatible with the spirit of peace in the Quran and Islam,\" and the only solution to the struggle over the site was \"love and reconciliation and the construction of the Third Temple on some empty land on the Temple Mount without damaging the existing Islamic sites there\".\\n\\nHaaretz journalist Asaf Ronel interviewed Oktar in 2018, shortly after speaking to a number of former supporters, who had described the ordeal of escaping his compound.\\n\\nMuch like Ahmad, Ronel was only allowed to conduct the interview with Oktar by appearing on his TV show. In the show, unlike Ahmad, he is surrounded by an audience of young men.\\n\\nAt one point, Ronel asked him about his relationship with Jews in Turkey, which he ignores and from which he quickly moves on, emphasising instead his Jewish friends in Israel. Later, he asks about a recent fine levied on his channel by the Turkish media regulator RTUK. Oktar blames Gulen, the Kurdistan Workers\\' Party (PKK), Islamic State, al-Qaeda and the Taliban, \"which are all pawns of the British deep state\", for pushing smears against him.\\n\\n\"I knew he was crazy and that he would say the British deep state was trying to take him down, but I also realised this type of craziness doesn\\'t really matter, it wasn\\'t meant for me. I was only a prop in the show he was providing for the people who were following him,\" Ronel told MEE.\\n\\n\"It was meant to show that he was an important person, that a journalist from Haaretz came all the way to Istanbul... but it didn\\'t really matter whether I believed him or not, I was only a prop in his performance.\"\\n\\nBlackmail\\n\\nIn July 2018, Oktar was arrested on a number of charges, including forming a criminal organisation, sexual abuse of children and sexual assault.\\n\\nAccording to the Istanbul chief prosecutor\\'s office, he was caught while attempting to run away from the arresting officers. As he was led away, he told journalists that the charges were a conspiracy by the British deep state.\\n\\n\"They are thinking of covering the whole region with Christianity. They targeted me because they saw me as the effective inhibitor of this game,\" he would later say in court.\\n\\nThough \"the British deep state\" has yet to officially comment on the case, many have questioned the timing of Oktar\\'s arrest, considering accusations against him dated back decades.\\n\\n\\'I think he was only saying what he thought would continue the beliefs of his followers and would allow him to get more followers and give him the money, and power and sex he wanted\\' - Asaf Ronel, journalist\\n\\nIn 1999, Oktar and a number of associates were arrested and charged with using threats for personal benefit and creating an organisation with the intent to commit a crime. A Turkish prosecutor listed a number of companies tied to BAV, which was accused of using blackmail and sex traps to generate revenue. The legal process against Oktar and BAV lasted two years, during which the majority of the complainants retracted their claims.\\n\\nIn the case file during his most recent trial, prosecutors presented an array of photos depicting sexual acts involving members of the organisation purportedly taken secretly at Oktar-owned properties for the purpose of blackmail. It also revealed WhatsApp messages involving male and female members of the group, in which they were given instructions to get used to anal sex.\\n\\nYuksel told MEE that he was aware of a number of senior politicians who had been involved with (or had relatives involved with) Oktar and were compromised by their association with him. However, he declined to offer any names.\\n\\nIt\\'s impossible to say for certain whether Oktar was simply an abusive grifter, or whether he sincerely believed in everything - or anything - he said.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think he believed in anything he was saying,\" said Ronel.\\n\\n\"I think he was only saying what he thought would continue the beliefs of his followers and would allow him to get more followers and give him the money, and power and sex he wanted.\"\\n\\nThis article is available in French on Middle East Eye French edition.',\n",
              " 'As undercover officers, Bob Lambert and his fellow detectives adopted the identities of dead children and had relationships with women they spied on. Then they turned their attention to British Muslims\\n\\nOne morning shortly after 9/11, with the remains of the Twin Towers still smouldering, thousands dead and missing and the world slowly accepting that many old certainties had vanished, two police officers met in a cafe across the road from London’s police headquarters at New Scotland Yard.\\n\\nBoth men were detectives with Special Branch - as the intelligence-gathering sections of British police forces are known - and both are said to have had long experience of counter-terrorism operations.\\n\\nThe al-Qaeda attacks had entirely dwarfed any plots that these men had encountered, however, and they must have realised that some of their previous investigations were looking somewhat trivial.\\n\\nAs they drank their coffees, the two men began to discuss plans to map London’s Muslim communities and organisations in a way that would enable them to gather intelligence about al-Qaeda’s influence within the city, and the risks that it posed.\\n\\nAt this time, Scotland Yard’s Special Branch was facing its own threat. Having already lost the lead role in tackling Irish republican militancy to the UK’s domestic security service, MI5, it was facing what amounted to a hostile takeover by the Yard’s Anti-Terrorist Branch, a unit which it had regarded as a rival for decades.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the new, post-9/11 world of policing, Special Branch needed to find a role for itself.\\n\\n\\'This Is Woke\\': The media outfit that\\'s actually a UK counter-terror programme Read More »\\n\\nThe two men in the cafe had between them many years of undercover experience, having infiltrated and spied upon many of the organisations they were investigating.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut they were aware that this was going to be all but impossible when it came to gathering information and spreading influence among London’s Muslim population.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the men, a detective inspector called Bob Lambert, suggested that they should operate in a way which would appear to be a more overt policing operation, drawing upon his experience of watching older Special Branch officers making contact with London’s Sikh communities following the 1985 bombing of an Air India flight over the Atlantic.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey decided they would set up an organisation that would come to be called the Muslim Contact Unit (MCU), and work collaboratively with leading Muslims, Islamic organisations and mosques, forming trust-based relationships in an attempt to counter the influence of al-Qaeda.\\n\\nA calm man, a good listener and quick learner, Lambert would in time win the admiration of many of the Muslims he met - “he was regarded as an honorary Muslim,” recalls one - as well as the respect of senior security officials at the British government\\'s Home Office.\\n\\nFollowing his retirement in 2007, Lambert embarked on an academic career in the growing field of security studies and was rewarded with an official honour for “services to policing”.\\n\\nBut as they talked and drank their coffees, neither man could have predicted that the earlier undercover work of Lambert and other members of the MCU would eventually be exposed to public gaze; nor that this unmasking would cause widespread revulsion at the way in which they had performed their duties, trigger a seemingly endless series of compensation claims against Scotland Yard and result in government ministers ordering a public inquiry.\\n\\n\\n\\nMoreover, once Lambert had been unmasked, a number of the Muslims who had cooperated with him would ask themselves whether his Muslim Contact Unit was all that it appeared to be.\\n\\n‘The Hairies’\\n\\nMuch of Lambert’s professional life had been shaped by his undercover work. It began in 1983, when he joined a Special Branch unit that had originally been formed 15 years earlier, after anti-Vietnam War protests outside the US embassy in London turned unexpectedly violent.\\n\\nSet up with the help of MI5, and officially known as the Special Demonstration Squad, the unit’s members had an unofficial nickname among those in the know at the Yard. As many of the male officers who joined it would grow long hair and often beards, they were known as “the Hairies”.\\n\\nThe rationale of the SDS was said to have been to provide intelligence on planned demonstrations that would help to prevent violent disorder. By the time Lambert joined the SDS, its officers had infiltrated a wide number of political groups, many of them focused on environmental issues and animal welfare.\\n\\nCalling himself “Bob Robinson”, and claiming to be a vegan who worked as a gardener, Lambert soon became a regular figure at animal rights demonstrations.\\n\\nWith his long curls and boyish grin, he was a popular figure who regularly hosted parties at his flat in north London. He was useful too - he owned a van, and would ferry fellow activists to protests. He spoke at meetings and helped to compose pamphlets.\\n\\nLambert photographed in his days undercover in the 1980s as \"Bob Robinson\", a purported animal rights activist\\n\\nSoon he was at the heart of two organisations: a small anti-capitalist group called London Greenpeace, which had no relation to the larger campaign group with the same name, and another called the Animal Liberation Front.\\n\\n“One day Bob wasn’t there,” recalls someone who thought of \"Bob Robinson\" as a friend and fellow activist. “And then Bob was there. He was everywhere.”\\n\\nHe was passionate, he was articulate, he was committed: nobody doubted Bob for a moment.\\n\\nAfter four years - which is now known to have been the usual period of deployment for undercover SDS detectives - Bob announced to his London Greenpeace and ALF friends that he needed to lie low for a while: he believed the police were taking too close an interest in his activities.\\n\\nA few people received postcards from Bob, posted in Spain, but none saw him again, for more than 20 years.\\n\\n‘The Muslim desk’\\n\\nNo longer undercover, Lambert came back into the Yard, working with a Special Branch unit known as E Squad, which monitored suspected militant sympathisers in London. He is thought to have been stationed within a sub-unit then known informally at Special Branch as the Muslim desk.\\n\\nHe soon found himself back at the SDS, however, with the title of Controller of Operations, giving him responsibility for its day-to-day management.\\n\\nLambert appears to have been given enormous freedom. He took it upon himself to expand the work of the SDS across Britain, and decided that a change of name was in order to reflect the unit’s expanded role. SDS was said to now stand for the Special Duties Section.\\n\\nHe appears to have left his managerial role at the SDS behind some time before 9/11.\\n\\nAfter that meeting at the cafe across the road from Scotland Yard, Lambert secured a small amount of funding, discreet office space on the second floor of a disused police building near London’s King’s Cross station, and the secondment of a small number of officers, at least a few of them from the Muslim desk.\\n\\nThe Muslim Contact Unit never had more than a dozen detectives, according to Home Office sources. Initially, none were Muslim, although a few Muslim detectives were later seconded to the unit.\\n\\nLambert would later claim that the cafe meeting was prompted not by 9/11, but by the launch of US air strikes against Taliban targets in Afghanistan the following month. He must, however, have been giving considerable thought before those air strikes to the ways in which Special Branch could help to counter al-Qaeda.\\n\\nEU trained Algeria and Morocco police in online disinformation tactics Read More »\\n\\nHe also said that he was anxious to avoid past errors in counter-terrorism policing. “I remain stubbornly attached to error and claim complete responsibility for my own mistakes,” he would later write.\\n\\nHowever, he then went on to state that the errors he had in mind were those made during Northern Ireland’s Troubles. He had “learned from mistakes in countering Irish republican terrorism”; police should have targeted terrorists, not political activists, and certainly not ordinary Irish Catholic communities, which he said “bore the brunt of stereotyping, profiling and stigmatisation”.\\n\\nWith the MCU up and running, Lambert says he set out to approach every mosque and Muslim association in the London area.\\n\\nHe also befriended a number of leading members of the Stop the War Coalition, a loose alliance of leftists, pacifists and Muslims that had formed in the weeks after 9/11. He was regularly to be seen on the Coalition’s marches, including one in February 2003, ahead of the US-led invasion of Iraq, that was the biggest protest ever held in the UK.\\n\\nHundreds of thousands marched in London in February 2003 to oppose the invasion of Iraq (AFP)\\n\\nMany who met him at that time were quietly impressed. “I came to know Bob through the demonstrations that we held as the Muslim Association of Britain from 2002-3, and then the demonstrations regarding Palestine,” recalls Anas Altikriti, former president of the Muslim Association of Britain and the founder of the Cordoba Foundation, which aims to strengthen understanding between the Muslim world and the West.\\n\\n“Up until 2005, he used to attend all of those demonstrations. I gathered he was there to check that things were going smoothly and to get to know a few people, and that didn’t surprise me.\\n\\n“I found him to be a pleasant person, I found him to be courteous. I found him to be approachable. I found him to be someone who was keen to listen.”\\n\\n“He was a really polite, gentle person,” says Azzam Tamimi, the British-Palestinian academic. Daud Abdullah of the Muslim Council of Britain recalls: “He could put you at ease, you felt easy in his company.”\\n\\nIt was not only Lambert’s demeanour that impressed - so too did his apparent willingness to engage with Muslims on the basis of their perspectives: he did not attempt to sell the positions of the British government or Scotland Yard to the people with whom he met and talked. And that gave some of them hope that he would, in turn, reflect those Muslim perspectives back to the Home Office.\\n\\nLambert later wrote that after his initial conversations he decided to attempt to remodel traditional community police methods in order to develop an innovative strand of counter-terrorism work.\\n\\n“As head of the MCU… I helped form partnerships that empowered representatives of mosques and Muslim organisations against the influence of al-Qaeda propagandists, strategists and apologists in local communities in London.”\\n\\nThat is not quite how everyone at the Home Office would describe the work. “They recruited moderate extremists to counter the extremist extremists,” one senior official says bluntly.\\n\\nConfronting Abu Hamza\\n\\nWhatever the form of words used to describe the MCU’s efforts, the unit quickly notched up some remarkable successes.\\n\\nAt Brixton in south London, the MCU found a Salafi community - including many Black converts to Islam - that had been attempting to counter the influences of al-Qaeda propagandists for years before 9/11 and, indeed, long before the term al-Qaeda had gained any great currency.\\n\\nTwo men who had prayed at Brixton - Zacarias Moussaoui, who would later plead guilty to conspiracy to murder on 9/11, and Richard Reid, the would-be shoe bomber - had fallen under the influence of radical clerics who years earlier were ejected from the mosque.\\n\\nHow a book on Cold War propaganda inspired British counter-terror campaign Read More »\\n\\nLambert and his MCU colleagues learned how the Brixton Salafis had countered the influence of these clerics through study circles or one-to-one counselling sessions. On one occasion, when one of the barred clerics, the charismatic Jamaica-born Abdullah al-Faisal, entered the mosque with dozens of supporters and attempted to speak, they resorted to the simple expedient of shutting down the public address system.\\n\\nThe MCU and the Brixton Salafis set up a company called Strategy to Reach, Empower and Educate Teenagers - Street Ltd - from offices near Brixton, to help foster such bottom-up initiatives to counter the influence of clerics such as Faisal.\\n\\nOn the other side of London, meanwhile, the MCU enjoyed even greater success.\\n\\nThe mosque at Finsbury Park in north London had fallen under the control of the Egyptian preacher Abu Hamza al-Masri. Following a police raid on the mosque in 2003, he had been preaching to hundreds in the streets outside.\\n\\nAbu Hamza al-Masri, pictured ouside Finsbury Park mosque in 2002 (Reuters)\\n\\nIn early 2005, the Muslim Association of Britain, with the support of the MCU and assistance from local police, MI5, the area’s MP, Jeremy Corbyn, and the office of London’s then-mayor, Ken Livingstone, was able to take control of the mosque from Abu Hamza and his supporters.\\n\\nBy this time, Lambert and his colleagues had reached an important perspective. “The MCU was at its strongest,” he later wrote, “when advocating the knowledge and skills of its Salafi and Islamist partners: street credibility; religious credibility; understanding al-Qaeda ideology; understanding al-Qaeda recruitment methodology; counselling skills; and commitment and bravery.”\\n\\nThe origins of Prevent\\n\\nAround a year after Lambert’s meeting at the cafe across the road from New Scotland Yard, the British government’s newly-appointed chief security and intelligence co-ordinator, David Omand, began to redraw the country’s counter-terrorism strategy. Omand called it Contest, and would later say that this “was a name I literally dreamt up in the bath”.\\n\\nInitially, according to Home Office sources, the greatest emphasis was placed on three of the four strands of Contest which Omand termed Protect, Prepare and Pursue.\\n\\nLittle attention is said to have been paid at that time to the fourth strand, known as Prevent, which Omand describes as an effort “to counter any attractiveness that [al-Qaeda’s] ideology might have for young people”.\\n\\nLike the rest of Contest, the existence of the Prevent programme was not made public at that time: that did not happen until 2005.\\n\\nOver the years, with its focus on Muslim communities and its growing determination - described in documents that were not intended to see the light of day - to bring about “attitudinal and behavioural change” among young British Muslims, the programme would come to be seen as deeply divisive.\\n\\nWhat is the Prevent Strategy? + Show - Hide Prevent is a strand of the British government\\'s counter-terrorism strategy that aims to “safeguard and support those vulnerable to radicalisation, to stop them from becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism”. It was publicly launched in the aftermath of the 2005 London bombings and was initially targeted squarely at Muslim communities, prompting continuing complaints of discrimination and concerns that the programme was being used to collect intelligence. In 2011, Prevent\\'s remit was expanded to cover all forms of extremism, defined by the government as “vocal or active opposition to fundamental British values, including democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs.” In 2015, the government introduced the Prevent Duty which requires public sector workers including doctors, teachers and even nursery staff to have “due regard to the need to prevent people being drawn into terrorism”. A key element of Prevent is Channel, a programme that offers mentoring and support to people assessed to be at risk of becoming terrorists. Prevent referrals of some young children have proved contentious. 114 children under the age of 15 received Channel support in 2017/18. Criticism of the Prevent Duty includes that it has had a “chilling effect” on free speech in classrooms and universities, and that it has turned public sector workers into informers who are expected to monitor pupils and patients for “signs of radicalisation”. Some critics have said that it may even be counter-productive. Advocates argue that it is a form of safeguarding that has been effective in identifying and helping troubled individuals. They point to a growing number of far-right referrals as evidence that it is not discriminatory against Muslims. In January 2019 the government bowed to pressure and announced that it would commission an independent review of Prevent. This was supposed to be completed by August 2020. After being forced to drop its first appointed reviewer, Lord Carlile, over his past advocacy for Prevent, it conceded that the review would be delayed. In January 2021 it named William Shawcross as reviewer.\\n\\nAfter the existence of the programme was revealed, British Muslims who engaged with Lambert and the MCU say these police officers were always at pains to present themselves as “anti-Prevent”.\\n\\nThat is not how the MCU’s role was seen within the Home Office, where the MCU was considered an integral part of the programme. There, officials say the unit’s “street empowerment” work was regarded, in Prevent’s early days, as one of its key components.\\n\\nThe MCU always remained under the control of Scotland Yard, but Lambert frequently attended meetings at the Home Office’s Whitehall headquarters.\\n\\nThere, he is said to have displayed a deep - and impressive - understanding of the structures of London’s Muslim communities, and of the beliefs of the Islamists and Salafis whom he sought to empower.\\n\\nREVEALED: How government feud shaped UK\\'s counter-extremism strategy Read More »\\n\\nPrivately, some senior officials at the Home Office compare the MCU’s work to Britain’s end-of-empire support for “moderates” within colonial independence movements, pitting them against “extremists”; or with official behind-the-scenes support for British socialists during the Cold War, in order to counter the influence of communists.\\n\\nSome of Lambert’s comments at Home Office meetings caused eyebrows to be raised, however, not least when he described suicide bombings as “martyrdom operations”.\\n\\nHe seems to have been indulged, with some putting his language down to the deep immersion techniques he had drawn upon while serving as a police spy. Some jokingly asked each other whether Bob had “gone native”.\\n\\nBut a few people came to see him as a curiously insubstantial figure, one who readily absorbed some of the words and concepts of whatever world he happened to be delving into.\\n\\n“I’ve no doubt he really believed everything he was saying,” says one official, “just as he really believed in animal rights when he was spying on the Animal Liberation Front.”\\n\\n‘Lunacy at the Yard’\\n\\nWhen it arrived, the backlash against the Muslim Contact Unit came from several directions at once.\\n\\nFrom 2005, a number of right-of-centre think tanks, blogs and commentators began to question and then condemn partnerships of the sort pioneered by the MCU. Respected observers described the unit as “weird”, and headlines such as “Lunacy at the Yard” began to appear in the press.\\n\\nThe authors argued that attempts to prevent only violent extremism fell dangerously short of the mark; in order to save future generations of Muslims from radicalisation, the Prevent programme needed to combat “non-violent extremism” and to promote what were hailed as “British values”.\\n\\nMeanwhile, October 2006 finally saw the hostile takeover that Lambert and his Special Branch colleagues had feared: the branch was merged with the Yard’s Anti-Terrorist Branch to form a new organisation called Counter-Terrorism Command.\\n\\nSenior officers at the Yard commented that Special Branch had come to be seen as being “a bit too soft” at a time when the government said it was waging war on terror.\\n\\nFrom then on, Muslim organisations who contacted Scotland Yard to ask for assistance with hate crime, for example, say they were sometimes sent an officer from the Prevent programme. If they asked to see someone else, it was likely to be a detective from Counter-Terrorism Command.\\n\\nBob Lambert, then working at the Muslim Contact Unit, speaks at a security conference in Copenhagen in 2007 (AFP)\\n\\n“The Muslim Contact Unit offered a valuable space for Muslims to interact with the police,” says Massoud Shadjareh, chair of the London-based Islamic Human Rights Commission. “And that space had shrunk.”\\n\\nA week after the Yard’s merger, British government ministers announced that they would be seeking new partners among the country’s Muslim communities. This was the start of a process that eventually led to a number of the MCU’s collaborators being “declared outcast”, as Lambert would later put it.\\n\\nThe following year, having served as a police officer for 30 years, Lambert was able to retire on a full pension. One person who was invited to his retirement party recalls that he was much like most of the other people in the very large room: “A typical copper.”\\n\\nSo was this the real Bob? Or was it more method acting?\\n\\nAcademic pursuits\\n\\nOn retiring, Lambert began to forge an academic career at the universities of Exeter and St Andrews. Drawing upon his experiences with the MCU and London’s Muslim communities, he studied for a PhD.\\n\\nHe also set up a private company called Siraat Ltd, from an office in south London, a couple of hundred yards from the secret location from which his undercover Special Branch colleagues ran the Special Demonstration Squad.\\n\\nSiraat - “path” in Arabic - stood for the Strategic Islamic Research Advice and Action Team. The company identified individuals who could be sent into prisons across Britain to mentor young Muslim inmates.\\n\\nThe attacks on the MCU’s methods and collaborations continued, however, with Lambert’s enemies pointing out that he had advocated “police negotiation leading to partnership with Muslim groups conventionally deemed to be subversive to democracy”. The MCU’s critics appeared to be on a roll, and the important caveat - “conventionally” - was of little consequence.\\n\\nThose attacks culminated in a 2009 report entitled Choosing Our Friends Wisely, published by the Policy Exchange think tank. It is a report that is said to made a considerable impression upon the Conservative politician Theresa May, who within a few months would become home secretary.\\n\\nPressing on undaunted, Lambert turned his PhD thesis into a book, Countering al-Qaeda in London: Police and Muslims in Partnership. Curiously, the 402-page book makes no mention of Siraat.\\n\\nHow Chris Morris took down the FBI\\'s fake plots with terror comedy Read More »\\n\\nIt does contain a robust defence of his work with the MCU. “It was the identity of my Muslim partners that undermined it in the eyes of [his critics],\" he writes. “If instead I had worked in partnership with Muslims who they deemed to be moderate and to be hostile to the Muslim Brotherhood - not connected to it - then they and their allies would not have sought to denigrate my work”.\\n\\nIn September 2011, the book was launched at the House of Commons. The event was hosted by Jeremy Corbyn, the Cordoba Foundation and the Council for Arab-British Understanding.\\n\\nIt was the highpoint of a policing and academic career that spanned 34 years.\\n\\nIt is no exaggeration to say that six weeks later, Lambert’s world - or worlds - would simply fall apart.\\n\\nBreaking ‘the golden rule’\\n\\nFor years, Lambert had warned the SDS detectives whom he managed that they needed to keep a very low profile once their undercover deployment came to an end.\\n\\nHe wrote in one Special Branch document that the continuation of cover, post-deployment, was “the golden rule” of SDS tradecraft. And yet, as an academic, he was giving lectures, speaking at conferences, appearing on university websites.\\n\\nThe long curls had gone, and instead there was a greying beard. But he was instantly recognisable across the years. He was “Bob Robinson”.\\n\\nOne Saturday afternoon in October 2011, Lambert had just finished speaking at an anti-racism conference in London, when he was challenged by five of his old friends from London Greenpeace.\\n\\nAs the five began handing out leaflets headed “The Truth About Bob Lambert and His Special Branch Role”, he stepped down from the stage and slipped out of a side entrance.\\n\\nHe was followed down the street by a number of the London Greenpeace activists, who asked him if he would like to have a chat, or perhaps say sorry. He briskly walked away.\\n\\nIn an explanation that appeared briefly on the University of St Andrews website, Lambert said: “I can well understand that the passage of time will have done nothing to diminish their anger towards someone they believed was a trusted comrade but was in reality an undercover police officer.”\\n\\nBut from then on, more revelations about “Bob Robinson” came spilling out, each one more ugly than the last.\\n\\nHe is alleged in 1987 to have taken part in an Animal Liberation Front firebombing campaign, in which three branches of a department store chain, Debenhams, were attacked because they sold fur coats.\\n\\nTwo men were arrested - almost certainly on information provided by Lambert - prosecuted and jailed. One of these men says that the incendiary devices they used had been divided between three activists, and that “Robinson” was one of them.\\n\\nThe three set off for different stores, with “Robinson” assigned to one in Harrow, north west London. All three devices ignited, and the store at Harrow suffered £340,000-worth of damage.\\n\\nLambert has been accused in parliament of having been responsible for that attack. He denies the allegation, but does admit to having appeared in court on other charges under the name Robinson. And he has not yet explained how the firebomb that he is said to been given was later placed inside the store.\\n\\n\\'Don\\'t get yourselves caught\\': How the British state allowed its secret agents to commit crime Read More »\\n\\nIt emerged too that there had once been a real Bob Robinson. Mark Robert - “Bob” - Charles Robinson had passed away in October 1959 of a congenital heart defect. This Bob had been seven years old when he died.\\n\\nHe had been the only child of Joan and William Robinson, who died in 2009 and are buried in the same grave as their son. The headstone in the cemetery in Dorset, south west England, remembers them as “Mummy” and “Daddy”.\\n\\nLambert had stolen the dead boy’s identity. He had also carried out research on the boy’s family, and probably visited the grave and the area where he lived his short life.\\n\\nThere was nothing unusual about this within the SDS at that time. An SDS tradecraft manual, published by the inquiry into UK undercover policing in 2018, in advance of any public hearings, explained how SDS officers who were about to go undercover should acquire a copy of the birth certificate of what the manual describes as “an ex person”.\\n\\nThe manual then suggests that the SDS officer should establish the “respiratory status” of that person’s family, before going on to “assume squatter’s rights over the unfortunate’s identity for the next four years”.\\n\\nIt is a document that appears to ooze contempt for the people being spied upon, whom the Hairies invariably termed “wearies” - SDS jargon for activists whom they believed droned on about their political causes in a wearisome manner - as well as for the families of the dead children whose identities were being taken.\\n\\nA parliamentary committee condemned the practice of stealing dead children’s identities as “abhorrent”.\\n\\nBut there was worse to come.\\n\\nIntimate relationships\\n\\nAs “Bob Robinson”, Lambert had had intimate relationships with four of the women he had been spying on.\\n\\nOn being unmasked, he claimed to have fallen in love with the women, and apologised publicly to them. “They were fine upstanding citizens who really should not have had the misfortune to meet me,” he said.\\n\\nHis wife and two children, living in a small town north of London, had known nothing about these relationships. “I think, with hindsight, I could only begin to understand it by thinking about the immersion I had in my role. I think I probably became too immersed in my alter ego Bob Robinson. I think I probably lost contact with who I really was…”\\n\\nOne of the women with whom he had a relationship had borne his child, a boy born in 1985. After two years, “Bob Robinson” had suddenly vanished from the life of the boy and his mother.\\n\\nIn 2014, Scotland Yard paid the mother more than £400,000 to settle a claim she had brought. She has said that she feels as though she had been “raped by the state”.\\n\\nIn October 2020, the Yard paid substantial damages to Lambert’s son, who is said to have suffered psychiatric damage after discovering, at the age of 26, that his father had been an undercover detective spying on his mother.\\n\\nThese victims were far from alone. So far, more than 30 women have come forward to say that they were tricked into having relationships with SDS spies. Lambert was not the only undercover detective who fathered a child.\\n\\nA number of those women have spoken publicly about the devastating impact that the police deception has had upon their lives. Many of them do not wish to be identified. The police spies’ wives are also devastated.\\n\\nThere was a “considerable overlap” between the SDS and the MCU, according to a well-placed Home Office source, who said that several undercover detectives joined Lambert’s Muslim liaison team.\\n\\nAt least one of these officers had intimate relations with several women he was spying on, under the cover name Jim Sutton, before joining the MCU.\\n\\nHis real name was Jim Boyling, and after Lambert retired from the police he helped to manage Siraat. Boyling is said by one person who knew him well to have also been involved with Street Ltd, where he is said to have used a false identity to pay the bills for its offices.\\n\\nJim Boyling was another undercover police officer who went on to work at the Muslim Contact Unit\\n\\nMizan Rahman, a Muslim activist and poet who was the office manager at Siraat, recalls Lambert and Boyling as being “really good actors”, and particularly skilled at deflecting questions about their personal lives.\\n\\n“If we asked questions about their wives or families, they would brush them away in a way that didn’t make you suspicious,” he recalls.\\n\\nAs a member of the MCU, Boyling is said to have travelled to Jordan, and to have also visited Israel shortly after a British suicide bomber, Asif Mohammed Hanif, murdered three people and injured more than 50 others at a Tel Aviv seafront bar, Mike’s Place, in April 2003.\\n\\nHamas later claimed responsibility for the attack.\\n\\nA second would-be suicide bomber, Omar Khan Sharif, also British, vanished after his explosive belt failed to detonate. His body washed up on a Tel Aviv beach two weeks later.\\n\\nThere is reason to believe Boyling may have travelled to Israel with DNA samples taken from the attackers’ family members, while Sharif was missing.\\n\\nREVEALED: Britain and Jordan’s secret war in Libya Read More »\\n\\nOn returning to the UK, he is said to have confided in a number of people that he had concluded that Sharif had been in Israeli custody before his body was discovered, but had made clear that he was not concerned to investigate his death.\\n\\nBoyling’s past also came back to haunt him while he was serving with the MCU. One of the women with whom he had a relationship had spent years trying to find him after he walked out of her life, even spending several months searching for him in South Africa after a number of postcards arrived from there.\\n\\nIn November 2001, just weeks after Lambert had decided to set up the MCU, she traced him to an anonymous office alongside a bus station in south London, and sat in a pub across the road, watching the entrance.\\n\\nTwo days later “Jim Sutton” walked into the bookshop where she worked, several miles away, confessed that he had been a police spy, and professed his undying love. Within weeks she was pregnant, and shortly after that they married.\\n\\nAccording to a statement made at the opening of the public inquiry into undercover policing inquiry, by a lawyer representing 22 of the deceived women, this was the start of “an increasingly abusive and controlling relationship”, which lasted almost a decade.\\n\\nDuring this time, Boyling is said to have stopped his new wife from alerting her old activist acquaintances that their boyfriends may also have been undercover detectives. Steps were being taken, the public inquiry has heard, to prevent the wife of Boyling, the MCU officer, from exposing the activities of the SDS.\\n\\nAccording to the statement made on behalf of the 22 women, many of their careers were upended, some were deceived into having children, others missed their chance to have children while in relationships with men they never knew to be police officers.\\n\\n“All of the women, on discovering the truth, have had their personal histories, their sense of self and their ability to trust destroyed.”\\n\\n‘Justice needs to be served’\\n\\nSome of the Muslims who engaged with Lambert and the MCU were so appalled by the revelations that they cannot bring themselves to talk about the relationship they forged with him.\\n\\nAnas Altikriti says: “When the story broke, I was one many who simply couldn’t believe what we were reading.”\\n\\nHe invited Lambert to a meeting, with several other people, where he confirmed that it was true. “I said Bob is there anything coming out and he said no. Adamantly he said no. And that turned out to be untrue.”\\n\\nSome at the meeting, who had been criticised within their community for engaging so closely with the police “were quite agitated and angry and upset, believing they had been tricked into the relationship”.\\n\\nMany London Muslims who had contact with Lambert broke it off immediately. One Muslim activist who had extensive contact with the MCU said his view at that time was: “There’s no way we can associate with Bob, and justice needs to be served.\\n\\n“We didn’t see Bob as having done something bad with the MCU because of this, we thought – ‘you’ve done something in your past, and you haven’t dealt with it and now it’s caught up with you, you need to deal with it, and there needs to be justice’. I did speak to him about this, and he couldn’t say much, but I said I feel from my religious point of view, until justice has been done, I can’t work with you. And he understood that.”\\n\\nMizan Rahman says: “I’m glad I haven’t seen Bob Lambert since, because I don’t know how I would react.”\\n\\nAmid the mounting scandal, Lambert was forced to resign a number of his academic posts and Boyling was dismissed from the police following a disciplinary hearing.\\n\\nBoyling’s most serious offence, ironically, appears not to have been that he had tricked his targets into intimate relationships, but that he had then married one of them without informing his superiors, and disclosed to her a number of secrets from his undercover days.\\n\\nRevelations about the SDS continue to emerge, not least through the public inquiry. That inquiry was ordered by Theresa May after a whistle-blower who had served in the unit revealed that it had mounted a surveillance operation against campaigners supporting the family of Stephen Lawrence, the victim of a notorious racist murder.\\n\\nThe Yard’s failure to properly investigate that murder had led to a previous inquiry concluding that police were guilty of what it termed “institutional racism”. And here they were, spying on the people who were campaigning to achieve the justice that they had failed to secure.\\n\\nThe new disclosures show that the SDS frequently targeted peaceful, law-abiding activists.\\n\\nPrevent police \\'tried to recruit asylum seeker as mosque informant\\' Read More »\\n\\nOne undercover officer who used the cover name Lynn Watson – and was one of the few women to serve in the SDS – had danced around in public while dressed as a clown. Her task had been to infiltrate a street performance campaign group called the Clandestine Insurgent Rebel Clown Army.\\n\\nAnother undercover detective spent time building orange tanks out of plywood and cardboard after inveigling himself into a group campaigning against the arms trade.\\n\\nIn the aftermath of 9/11, when Bob Lambert and his colleague met for coffee across the road from Scotland Yard, they must have been almost painfully aware of the pressing need for Special Branch to start doing something to counter a real threat.\\n\\nBut one question about the Muslim Contact Unit remains unanswered, almost 20 years after that meeting.\\n\\nWere its aims as described by Lambert: was it a trust-based community policing initiative, which aimed to engage with Muslims to counter the influence of al-Qaeda?\\n\\nOr was the MCU, staffed as it was by surveillance experts, another espionage operation?\\n\\n‘They were obviously eavesdropping’\\n\\nOne person recalls an intriguing encounter with the MCU at a mosque in west London, a couple of years after the unit was founded.\\n\\nShe and a colleague were there for a talk about Binyam Mohamed, the British resident who was at that time incarcerated at Guantanamo Bay, after being rendered from Pakistan via Morocco.\\n\\n“We arrived early and sat alone in the mosque cafe. Two men came and sat at the next table. They were a white man with a beard and an Asian-looking man with a turban.\\n\\n“The rest of the cafe was empty and they could have sat anywhere, but they sat right next to us. They were obviously eavesdropping on us.\\n\\n“So we invited them to come and join us at our table. They introduced themselves as members of the Muslim Contact Unit, part of Special Branch. The bearded man explained that his name was Bob Lambert.”\\n\\nAsked whether he thought the MCU was spying on the Muslims with whom it engaged, Daud Abdullah replies: “I wouldn’t rule it out.”\\n\\nAbdullah was teaching Islamic studies at colleges in London. When MCU members enrolled as students, he wondered whether they were monitoring the course content and the students’ reactions.\\n\\nAnd whenever he travelled abroad, his mobile phone often would ring, and the caller would say: “Hello Daud, Bob here…”\\n\\n“I was unsure whether he was passing a message – that they knew I was travelling - or whether it was just a coincidence. It happened on several occasions.”\\n\\nIn response to a request made under freedom of information law, the Yard said it possessed no records about the MCU dating from the period when it was created, possibly because they had been “weeded” in line with its data retention and disposal policy.\\n\\nHowever, internal Special Branch papers made available by the public inquiry into undercover policing include two documents that show clearly that at the time Lambert was openly befriending the leading lights of the Stop the War Coalition, his SDS colleagues were busy spying on them.\\n\\nSDS officers also approached a number of women at protests against the impending invasion of Iraq in 2003, organised by the Stop the War Coalition.\\n\\nOne, calling himself Carlo Neri, is alleged to have proposed to the woman he targeted. She says she accepted and introduced him to her family as a prospective son-in-law. He too eventually upped and vanished.\\n\\nIn Countering al-Qaeda in London, Lambert is ambiguous about the extent to which the MCU was an intelligence-gathering operation.\\n\\nHe denies that it was, but at the same time writes admiringly of police officers who have been able deftly to reframe questions about whether community policing is a “double-edged tool”.\\n\\nHe also writes: “A commitment to the principles of community policing [is] more likely to produce good intelligence than its abandonment.”\\n\\nSome Muslims who had dealings with the MCU are quite relaxed about the possibility of it having been an intelligence-gathering operation.\\n\\nAltikriti says he assumed Lambert was gathering intelligence when first they met. “I wouldn’t be surprised if that wasn’t one of his objectives, during the times of the demonstrations and marches.\\n\\n“I don’t think that that was the objective or the aim, of our encounters later on, particularly when they became more focused on the academic line. He was being attacked equally as we were.”\\n\\nA Muslim activist who engaged with the MCU says he always pointed out to people that they were dealing with Special Branch. “I made clear to anyone who was going to talk to them that they were Special Branch, and the only role of Special Branch is to gather intelligence, so people knew everything they were saying was being recorded, and would be on a file somewhere.\\n\\n“We’d say that in front of Bob and the others. I’d remind people ‘he is a very nice guy, but …’”\\n\\n“It was useful for police to learn about the structure of Muslim communities and there is a legitimate need for Muslims to have some input into policing,” says Massoud Shadjerah.\\n\\n“But we were not naive about the MCU as an intelligence-gathering operation. There was a lack of intelligence within the Metropolitan Police. Gaining that knowledge is not illegitimate in itself. What is a problem is when police look at communities only from the point of view of terrorism. That is problematic.”\\n\\nAnd since the closure of the MCU, Shadjerah says, and the folding of Special Branch into the Counter-Terrorism Command, that happens far more frequently.\\n\\n‘Learning from mistakes’\\n\\nBob Lambert remains proud of his work with the MCU.\\n\\nIn one of the few media interviews he gave, to Channel 4 News, he admitted that the relationships he had formed with the women he was spying upon had been “weak on my part … irresponsible”. When the interviewer put it to him that it had actually been cruel, he replied: “Yes, yes absolutely.”\\n\\nHe added: “Whatever is said, my reputation is never going to be redeemed for many people and I don’t think it should be. I think I made serious mistakes that I should regret and I always will do.\\n\\n“The only real comfort I can take from my police career is the fact that the Muslim Contact Unit was about learning from mistakes.\\n\\n“That unit was a genuine attempt to work with the Muslim community, Muslim individuals in London, to tackle al-Qaeda or the al-Qaeda threat in the aftermath of 9/11.”\\n\\nBob Lambert was interviewed by Channel 4 in 2014 (YouTube)\\n\\nLambert declined to be interviewed by Middle East Eye.\\n\\nJim Boyling declined to answer questions, or comment on the allegations made about him at the undercover policing inquiry. In an email, his lawyer said: “Mr Boyling intends to provide his evidence to the Inquiry and in the circumstances it would be inappropriate to comment at this time.”\\n\\nInevitably, perhaps, questions may always linger around the method actors who moved from the Special Demonstration Squad to the Muslim Contact Unit.\\n\\nWere they being sincere, when they entered their new role? Moreover, does that question really matter, if the work they did was worthwhile?\\n\\nThe MCU appears to have been quietly closed down in 2016, several years after the SDS was closed. By that time, however, another undercover policing unit, the National Public Order Intelligence Unit, had already been created.\\n\\nMeanwhile, many of the undercover officers of the SDS have yet to be identified, including most of those who later joined the MCU. Some have been granted anonymity by the public inquiry.\\n\\nThere may well be women across Britain who do not know that the men they loved had been spying on them; Muslims who do not know that that the police officers who earnestly befriended them and sought to earn their trust had previously been engaged in manipulation, and abuse, and lies.\\n\\nPhoto: The sign outside New Scotland Yard is reflected outside the headquarters of the Metropolitan Police in central London on 4 March, 2014 (Reuters)',\n",

If it succeeds, a \\'two-headed dragon\\' will emerge\\n\\nTo say that Iraq\\'s Shia leaders are disappointed in the man who replaced Qassem Soleimani is an understatement. They are shocked.\\n\\nSoleimani, the top Iranian general who was killed in a US drone strike on 3 January, 2020, moved among them with ease. He knew each leader, commander and many of their subordinates personally. Their bond, forged over decades, was renowned.\\n\\nBrigadier General Esmail Qaani, the new commander of the Quds Force, Iran\\'s elite unit tasked with overseas operations, boasts none of the same qualities and appears uninterested in replicating them.\\n\\nIn fact, despite a tumultuous year when conflict with the United States seemed a distinct possibility, Qaani has met Iraq\\'s Shia leaders only a handful of times. His manner, the head of a prominent Shia political party said, resembled \"an official only concerned with delivering messages and instructions\".\\n\\n\\'Soleimani had charisma that could not be overlooked. He spoke Arabic and had extended relations with most Iraqi politicians and armed-faction commanders, regardless of their affiliation or sect\\' - Prominent Shia politician\\n\\nQaani, who cut his teeth in Afghanistan, has made no effort to break the ice with his new partners. His trips to Iraq are quick and businesslike. He invests no time in getting to know Iraq\\'s leaders.\\n\\n\"Soleimani had charisma that could not be overlooked. He spoke Arabic and had extended relations with most Iraqi politicians and armed-faction commanders, regardless of their affiliation or sect,\" said a prominent Shia politician, who like everyone interview by Middle East Eye for this story declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the subject.\\n\\n\"This made him close to everyone, built his stature and gave him influence over the leaders, which he used to push them in the direction he desired.\"\\n\\nSoleimani, say those who knew him, understood how to deal with each party - friend or foe.\\n\\n\"He could even find a settlement with opponents that made them feel that they\\'d reached a win-win situation,\" the politician said.\\n\\nQaani, on the other hand, doesn\\'t even personally know Ammar al-Hakim, the towering Shia political leader, despite his influence across all sects in Iraq.\\n\\n\"Imagine that!\" the politician said. \"He only knows his brother Mohsen instead.\"\\n\\nEsmail Qaani (C), weeping over the coffin his predecessor Qasem Soleimani during his funeral ceremony in Tehran (AFP)\\n\\nThe contrast between Soleimani\\'s confidence and access and Qaani\\'s officiousness is becoming the thing of legend in Iraq\\'s senior circles.\\n\\nWhile Soleimani would arrive in the country unannounced, Qaani applies for a visa weeks in advance.\\n\\nA new vision\\n\\nThe difference between Soleimani and Qaani matters. Iran has been unable to fill the void left by the general and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the godfather of most of the Iraqi armed factions who was killed alongside Soleimani.\\n\\nIn Soleimani\\'s absence, Iran-backed Iraqi paramilitaries such as Asaib Ahl al-Haq are slipping out of control, ignoring Qaani\\'s instructions.\\n\\nMeanwhile, sanctions-hit Tehran is looking nervously at Iraq\\'s own financial crisis, as low oil prices and the Covid-19 pandemic take their toll.\\n\\nTogether, these troublesome developments have forced Iran to \"review\" its foreign policy in the region and \"accelerate\" its plans to change tack in Iraq in particular, Iraqi politicians, leaders, security officials and armed faction commanders told Middle East Eye.\\n\\n\"The Iranians are currently working on a review of all of Soleimani\\'s plans in Iraq.

The goal now is to try new approaches and rearrange the situation inside Iraq to reduce losses.\"\\n\\nSources across Iraq\\'s political, paramilitary and security scenes say Iranian authorities tasked with Iraq actually began to change policy months ago. They expect the changes to be broadly reflected in Iraqi politics and security soon. Already, the policy shift is being felt on the ground, particularly among the armed factions.\\n\\n\"The idea is to change the vision according to which the American-Iranian conflict is being managed inside Iraq to match the recent developments locally and regionally,\" a senior adviser to Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi said.\\n\\nThree factors are being assessed by Iran: Joe Biden\\'s incoming administration, armed factions loyal to Iraq\\'s Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani breaking from the Hashd al-Shaabi paramilitary, and upcoming parliamentary elections in Iraq.\\n\\n\"The idea is no longer about the identity of the winner or loser in this struggle. The idea is how to survive these conflicts with the least possible losses,\" the adviser said.\\n\\n\"Iran cannot accept the total loss of Iraq, nor can it risk compromising its major national interests. Therefore, making some concessions and stepping back several steps seems a response typical of Iran at the current stage.\"\\n\\nThe rise of Iranian intelligence\\n\\nDuring the 80s, Iran was the main hotbed of Iraqi opposition against Saddam Hussein\\'s rule. Its intelligence services had an active role, working with a number of armed and unarmed Iraqi opposition forces inside and outside Iraq.\\n\\nBut Iranian intelligence\\'s influence in Iraq declined greatly after 2005, \"when the direct conflict erupted between Iran on the one hand and the US and British forces on the other hand,\" said a former fighter with the Badr Organisation, the oldest and largest Iraqi armed group opposing Saddam.\\n\\nInstead, the Quds Force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps\\' most feared arm, became the institution charged with carrying out Iranian operations outside the borders, a partner for Iranian intelligence in managing the Iraqi file.\\n\\nThe Revolutionary Guard took an active part in directing the fight against US and British troops, and was getting stronger domestically, too.\\n\\nIn 2014, the rise of the Islamic State group (IS) gave the Quds Force its next foothold.\\n\\nUnder Soleimani, the unit directed Iraqi militias as they played a pivotal role in stopping the militants from marching on Baghdad, rolling IS back from towns and cities across north and western Iraq, and seizing control over large areas of territory.\\n\\nSoldiers of the Hashd al-Shaabi wave the victory sign onboard a pickup truck, on their way to Tal Afar airport in 2016 (AFP)\\n\\nThe Quds Force now had complete control of Iran\\'s affairs in Iraq, Shia politicians and officials said. Tehran\\'s influence in the country had never been higher.\\n\\nBut underpinning this moment of victory was a tension that refused to subside, and a litany of paramilitary abuses were to follow, destabilizing Iraq as it recovered from the war against IS.\\n\\nThe Hashd al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilisation), a collection of armed factions, was formed in response to a fatwa issued by Sistani that called on Iraqis to mobilise against the militant group. Most were guided by Soleimani during the fight against IS.\\n\\nOnce the dust settled in 2017 and IS had been defeated, Tehran was able to impose near complete control over the Hashd al-Shaabi, which ignored its mandated acquiescence to the orders of the commander in chief of the Iraqi armed forces.\\n\\nUnder Iranian control, the Iran-backed groups in the Hashd subjected civilians to multiple human rights violations, and began posing a threat to Iraq\\'s government, people and the western diplomatic missions it hosted.\\n\\n\\'From the Iranian point of view, it is politics that should take centre stage now, not weapons\\' - Political leader close to Iran\\n\\nIn response, Sistani\\'s religious authority in Najaf demanded they be restructured and Iranian influence limited.\\n\\n\"The Iranians agreed to restructure the Hashd al-Shaabi just last year and were studying proposals to sacrifice some of the factions associated with them and merge other factions. But the project was stopped due to the outbreak of mass demonstrations in October 2019 and then the killing of Soleimani,\" said a political leader close to Iran.\\n\\n\"The killing of Soleimani did not impede the project, but it postponed implementation for a while.\"\\n\\nSoleimani\\'s death, Qaani\\'s failure to replicate his stature, and various pressing issues have also accelerated a move that was hatched in Tehran before that fateful drone strike on Baghdad airport: handing Iraq back to Iranian intelligence.\\n\\n\"It is no longer possible to risk losing more influence inside Iraq and the region,\" the political leader said.\\n\\nThe Quds Force is already retreating. According to the political leader, it is organising its assets in Iraq and stepping back from the front-line position it has held in Iraqi affairs.\\n\\n\"From the Iranian point of view, it is politics that should take centre stage now, not weapons.\"\\n\\nChanging tack\\n\\nTo many in Baghdad, the muddle of messages and actions coming out of Iran and its allies in Iraq reflects a conflict between the Revolutionary Guard and Iranian intelligence.\\n\\nSome Iraqi leaders believe intelligence is urging restraint to the armed factions, while the Quds Force is clandestinely encouraging them to attack US assets.\\n\\nThe truth is unclear, but all Iraqi leaders spoken to by MEE agree that Tehran\\'s vision for Iraq has fundamentally changed.\\n\\nThe vision, politicians and commanders of Iran-backed armed factions said, is based on three axes:\\n\\nEXCLUSIVE: Iran tells Iraq factions ‘no attacks on US targets until Trump is gone’ Read More »\\n\\nDismantling and dissolving some armed factions, or what they call \"removing the outcrops\"; supporting and strengthening the Iraqi government; and finding alternative sources of funding for its allies inside Iraq and protecting them with legally recognised political formations.\\n\\n\"The Iranians do not accept the existence of a strong unified force, so in recent years they worked to inflame the differences between the armed factions inside and outside the Hashd al-Shaabi, and this forced everyone, including the Iranians, into the state of chaos that we all are currently suffering from,\" another of Kadhimi\\'s advisers said.\\n\\n\"The proposed alternative is an acceptable government that enjoys some power but accepts the presence of a two-headed militia force. The pro-Iran Hashd al-Shaabi may be one of them. Therefore, rearranging the Iranian-backed Hashd al-Shaabi became very important at this time.\"\\n\\nThe first step, the adviser said, will be to find someone to replace Muhandis, co-founder of the fearsome Kataeb Hezbollah paramilitary whose influence among armed factions and closeness to Iran was unparalleled.\\n\\n\"Small factions like the Khorasani Brigades will disappear; some will turn into gangs, while others will merge with a greater force, and Iran will help implement this scenario because the factions have become an obstruction to the new Iranian policy.\"\\n\\nTwo-headed dragon\\n\\nThe many factions of the Hashd al-Shaabi share state-provided salaries, privileges and equipment. The majority were formed in 2014 at the behest of Sistani\\'s fatwa.\\n\\nBut their loyalties do not all lie in the same place. Some answer to Najaf, others to Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. The majority look to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who over the years has secured the loyalty of more groups through the promise of money, influence and weapons.\\n\\nNouri al-Maliki, prime minister when IS attacked in 2014, created the Popular Mobilisation Authority (PMA) that year in an attempt to fold the factions under a governmental umbrella. But Baghdad never grasped full control over the PMA.\\n\\nA November 2016 law to regularize the paramilitaries was passed in an attempt to combat that. The Hashd al-Shaabi were suddenly subjected to the same rules as the rest of Iraq\\'s security forces: factions\\' budgets, size and logistical support were curtailed along confessional and ethnic parameters.\\n\\n\\'Small factions like the Khorasani Brigades will disappear; some will turn into gangs, while others will merge with a greater force\\' - Advisor to Kadhimi\\n\\nArmed groups had been swelling over the past two years, and with the PMA now allowed to administer only a certain number of fighters, tens of thousands were left out in the cold without government salaries or support.\\n\\nInstead of cowing the paramilitaries, the 2016 law only increased the chaos.\\n\\nMost of the commanders now out of the PMA continued to take advantage of the perks enjoyed by the Hashd al-Shaabi, including IDs, wheels, weapons and headquarters, which they used \"to cover illegal activities and protect fighters who are not registered with the PMA,\" according to a security official.\\n\\nSome, the official said, used PMA resources and fighters \"to pursue personal and regional agendas and to be involved in acts of violence against civilians, state agencies and diplomatic missions\".\\n\\nHalf-in, half-out militiamen filled their coffers through drug trafficking and seizing the property of displaced civilians. They extorted companies and businessmen, and kidnapped unsuspecting Iraqis and foreigners for ransom.\\n\\nWhen protests broke out in October 2019, some began gunning down demonstrators and murdering or disappearing activists and journalists. Attacks on western diplomatic missions became routine.\\n\\nEnough has become enough for Iran, Iraqi leaders say. Tehran\\'s new plan suggests keeping the larger armed factions under the PMA, \"provided that they are cleaned and the protrusions cut,\" and dissolving the smaller ones altogether, according to the head of a prominent Shia party familiar with these matters.\\n\\nAs for the factions not registered with the PMA, two or three will be kept to represent what is known as the \"armed resistance,\" an unofficial anti-western paramilitary linked to the Quds Force.\\n\\nIraq\\'s Sistani-backed factions break from Popular Mobilisation in blow to Iran Read More »\\n\\nThe rest will be employed in economic and political projects.\\n\\nKataeb Hezbollah and Herekat Hezbollah al-Nujabaa are \"the two factions that are the most fortunate to survive and will form the nucleus of what will be known as the resistance forces,\" said a prominent commander of an Iran-backed Shia faction who is involved in the discussions.\\n\\nThe result will be two forces - the first a regularised Hashd al-Shaabi, the second the resistance force. \"A two-headed dragon,\" as the second Kadhimi adviser puts it.\\n\\n\"This proposal may be acceptable regionally and internationally, as there will be great opportunities to gradually restore state control over the first force, while it works in cooperation with Iran to keep the latter away from the Iraqi arena,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Everything will depend on what the Iranian-American negotiations will produce. If the Iranians succeed in returning to the nuclear agreement, Iran will retain the major factions while accepting the Iraqi government\\'s participation in controlling them.\"\\n\\nAll other fighters and factions are to be abandoned and left to the mercy of the Iraqi government and Washington.\\n\\n\"A goodwill gesture,\" the adviser said.\\n\\nRemoving outcrops\\n\\nThe importance Iran is placing on those future negotiations with Washington cannot be overestimated.\\n\\nThat\\'s why Tehran has issued strict instructions to its allies in Iraq to stop any attacks on US interests in the country, which the Iranians fear could prompt outgoing President Donald Trump to instigate a war before he leaves the Oval Office.\\n\\nYet raids on American forces, bases and the US embassy in Baghdad\\'s Green Zone have not stopped since Khamenei\\'s directive in November.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the US military build-up in the region is continuing. An Iraqi security official said the American intelligence community has said on multiple occasions that a \"retaliatory attack targeting US interests in Iraq on the first anniversary of Soleimani\\'s assassination is expected\".\\n\\nPictures of Qassem Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis are seen near the remains of their destroyed vehicles in Baghdad airport (Reuters)\\n\\nQaani, who visited Baghdad on 23 December, met with Kadhimi and President Barham Salih \"to impart a message to the Americans that Iran has nothing to do with the recent attacks\" that recently targeted the US embassy, an Iraqi Shia politician familiar with the talks said.\\n\\nThe general stressed that Tehran has no plans to retaliate on the anniversary of Soleimani\\'s death.\\n\\nQaani\\'s visit, which did not last for more than 24 hours, was followed by an official Iraqi delegation visiting Tehran on 27 December, headed by one of Kadhimi\\'s advisers.\\n\\nAlthough there is not much information on why an official delegation went to Iran a few days after Qaani\\'s visit, it is clear that the delegation carried an American response to the Iranian message.\\n\\nA number of Shia leaders suggest that the Iraqi delegation requested Iran\\'s assistance in pursuing \"uncontrolled elements\". They believe the delegation wanted an agreement with Iran over how to rein in unruly factions and increase coordination between Kadhimi and Mohammed \"Abu Fadek\" Abdulaziz, the PMA\\'s chief of staff.

Within two weeks, all the details related to Khorasani will be resolved and they will start with another faction,\" he said.\\n\\n\"The PMA Security Directorate is carrying out this process and it is the one that made recommendations to the leadership of the PMA to clean the Hashd al-Shaabi of corrupt elements and cut off the outgrowths.\"\\n\\nAlternative funding\\n\\nUltimately, both Iraq and Iran share the same reason to shake up the paramilitaries and pursue less confrontational policies: they are broke.\\n\\nIraq, Opec\\'s second-largest producer, has depended on oil sales for 95 percent of its budget for decades. But falling oil prices and the Covid-19 pandemic have hollowed out its revenues. Since April, Baghdad has struggled to secure the salaries of around four million state employees and beneficiaries.\\n\\nIsolated by US sanctions, Iran has for two years relied heavily on Iraq. Trade between the two is currently at around $12bn, and Iraq is one of the largest consumer markets for Iranian goods in the region.\\n\\nHowever, officials say, it is illicit activities in Iraq that provide Iran with the greater revenue, including the smuggling of currency, oil and drugs.\\n\\n\\'Man of settlements\\': Iraq\\'s Kadhimi walks the line in anti-corruption drive Read More »\\n\\nIraqi leaders told MEE that Muhandis used to secure Iran $100m-$135m per month by skimming off the PMA\\'s budget provided by the Baghdad government.

Iran does not have the money to keep them attached, as they have turned into a great burden on its shoulders,\" said a prominent commander of an Iranian-backed armed faction.\\n\\n\"But it also does not want to sacrifice them or lose control, as happened recently with some factions. One of the biggest reasons for Asaib Ahl al-Haq\\'s rebellion against Iran is that [its leader Qais] Khazali feels that he no longer needs Iran. Rather, he is richer without them and is much stronger.\"\\n\\nThe answer, Iran believes, is pastoral.\\n\\nShia armed factions have been commanded to buy or rent tens of thousands of acres of unclaimed land from the Iraqi government in the arid governorates of Samawah, Diwaniyah and Najaf along the Saudi border.\\n\\nThis is \"to form a security barrier with Saudi Arabia and prevent the Iraqi government from signing contracts with it in the future,\" the commander said.\\n\\nThere is no clear map or specific pattern for selecting these lands, but what is needed is the lower and more salty lands, rich in groundwater.\\n\\nA view of cattle sitting in the marshes (ahwar) of the southern district of Chibayish in Iraq\\'s Dhi Qar province (AFP)\\n\\nCommanders select land to acquire using satellite imagery, then task people close to their factions to draw up a deal with the Ministry of Agriculture,\\n\\nPoliticians and commanders familiar with the process told MEE that the contracts to lease these lands are very cheap. A square kilometre of land does not exceed one million dinars ($680), they said, and the state\\'s Agricultural Bank and the Ministry of Agriculture happily provide loans, investment, equipment and seeds.\\n\\nOn these lands crops such as potatoes, wheat and alfalfa will be grown. Poultry, cows and goats will be reared. Cement and phosphate factories will be erected.\\n\\n\"The plan is to pull the fighters of the armed factions who are not registered with the Hashd out of the cities and throw them into investment projects that secure jobs for them and keep them busy away from interior Iraq,\" the prominent commander said.\\n\\n\"This is how we will ensure that they stay together without getting into trouble or splitting up, and at the same time we will solve their financing problem. They will turn to civilian work completely, as happened with the Badr Organization after 2003, and as long as there is no external threat, they will put their weapons aside,\" he added.\\n\\n\"These weapons will not be handed over to the government, but they will disappear from the surface and the money that was used to buy more weapons will be invested elsewhere.\"\\n\\nPlaying politics\\n\\nKeeping Asaib Ahl al-Haq leader Khazali, one of the most \"ambitious\" Shia leaders linked to Iran, under control is one of the great challenges that Iran will face in its next project, Shia leaders say.\\n\\nKhazali did not hesitate to announce his public rejection of Iranian orders not to target US interests in Iraq, and although Asaib Ahl al-Haq insists that its fighters did not target the US embassy, the confessions provided by Azirjawi to investigators contradict the faction\\'s denials.\\n\\nIt is not clear now what the future of the relationship between Khazali and Iran will be. But what is certain is that Iran will do what is necessary to stop the friction and the competition between Asaib Ahl al-Haq and the rest of the factions, especially Kataeb Hezbollah.\\n\\n\\'Khazali is very provocative and tends to escalate and radicalise stances because he feels that the Iranians have let him down\\' - Commander of Iran-backed armed faction\\n\\nThe jostling between Asaib and Kataeb over spoils in Baghdad and other provinces, especially in the western Anbar and southern Ramadi, almost led to the outbreak of fighting between the two factions last month, when fighters from the former tried to set up security checkpoints in the areas controlled by the latter, and impose additional fees on trucks coming from Syria.\\n\\nA rivalry of another kind between Asaib and Herekat Hezbollah al-Nujaba is also rumbling on, but this time is centred around Khazali and Akram al-Kaabi.\\n\\nOnce brothers in arms, Kaabi and al-Nujaba split from Asaib in 2013. Now Khazali and Kaabi have fallen out over Kaabi\\'s perceived closeness to the leadership of factions set to become part of the \"resistance force\".\\n\\nShia leaders say Khazali thinks he should be the one to take command of the \"resistance force,\" believing himself more efficient and fierce than Kaabi. Yet even the name of Khazali\\'s brother Laith has been suggested before him.\\n\\nThe same type of competition is raging between Khazali and Abu Fadak, whose \"chances of succeeding al-Muhandis within the PMA are increasing\".\\n\\n\"Khazali is very provocative and tends to escalate and radicalise stances because he feels that the Iranians have let him down,\" the commander of a pro-Iran armed faction closed to the Asaib leader told MEE.\\n\\n\"He sees himself as the right one to lead the Shia armed scene, but the Iranians prefer not to support him for this position, especially since Asaib has been involved in politics a lot and now controls many ministries and top offices in the government.\\n\\n\"The Iranians see Khazali as a political leader rather than a fighter, as he is better at negotiating and bargaining than others.\"\\n\\nQais al-Khazali paying respects by the grave of slain Iraqi paramilitary chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in Najaf (AFP)\\n\\nKhazali\\'s credentials in politics are clear, as are his ambitions.\\n\\nAlready he controls 15 seats in parliament, but aspires to lead the biggest Iranian-backed bloc, al-Fatah, and has concluded an agreement with the leaders of the Shia blocs to form a quadripartite council, politicians and the bloc\\'s members said.\\n\\nThe council, they revealed, will include him and representatives from the Supreme Iraqi Islamic Council (ISCI), the National Sind bloc and the Badr Organization.

              " 'The history of the Middle East, and the recent teachings of the 2010-11 uprisings, highlight an important lesson: Ignore ecological integrity at your peril\\n\\nIn 149 BC, Marcus Porcius Cato - a politician, soldier and citizen dedicated to the study of agriculture - saw a major goal realised when Rome declared war on Carthage. When arguing for this in the senate, Cato brought with him an unlikely weapon: figs homegrown on enemy territory.\\n\\nThe figs were a delicacy, a sign of Carthaginian prestige. Cato aimed to demonstrate that as an agricultural powerhouse, Carthage represented both a threat and an opportunity. Thanks to the quality of its soils, Carthage was becoming a trade hub and a military rival - and it therefore needed to be defeated. If victorious, Rome could use Carthaginian lands to feed its growing empire. And so the Third Punic War began, ending in 146 BC with the defeat of Carthage.\\n\\nFigs decided the fate of a civilisation whose ruins now lie in modern-day Tunis. This is a reminder that what is known today as Tunisia was once a lush, productive terroir that cradled a civilisation overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, at a time when civilisational power stemmed from soil. The ability to grow in abundance was equated with security, political institutionalisation and the beginnings of trade. It was intertwined with population growth, territorial expansion and cultural standing.\\n\\nLost habitats\\n\\nLike many civilisations before and after, however, Rome made the mistake of exhausting its own soils and those of its conquered territories to their ecological limits. With erosion, deforestation and intensive agriculture, soils lost their ability to harbour life, retain water and provide ecological services, such as carbon storage, productivity or temperature regulation. Entire habitats were lost in the process, and Rome eventually fell, leaving in its wake landscapes that were well on their way to extreme desertification.\\n\\nFast-forward two millennia. 2020 draws to a close amid lockdowns around the world. This year brought home a virus, along with a realisation of the dangers ahead of us due to systematic encroachment on ecosystems that normally preserve planetary, animal and human health.\\n\\nI am tempted to ask where the figs of Carthage have gone, what story Tunisian soils tell us about the Arab Spring, and about the future of the Middle East in a climate-disrupted world\\n\\nAs we let go of this year, we also commemorate the Arab Spring: a series of revolutions whose fallout led to wars in Yemen, Libya and Syria, the strengthening of stifling authoritarianism in Egypt, and the arduous fight for credible democracy in Tunisia. Citizens whose dignity and agency had been stripped away descended to the streets to demand change and to overturn the concentration of political and economic power in the hands of the few who discriminated against the many.\\n\\nMany analysts ask whether the Arab Spring has turned to winter, whether it has succeeded at all, and where it left the region. On the other hand, I am tempted to ask where the figs of Carthage have gone, what story Tunisian soils tell us about the Arab Spring, and about the future of the Middle East in a climate-disrupted world.\\n\\nThe story of the Middle East is one of continuous change, of which the Arab Spring is but one chapter. It was not an awakening - a notion that might come close to an insult in a region where encounters are charged with acute political awareness. Rather, it was a tidal wave that garnered energy accumulated over decades of growing pauperisation, corrupt governance and political abuse. The backdrop of this wave, which had been a long time in the making, was slower and quieter: ecological depletion in the Middle East and around the globe.\\n\\nStruggle for survival\\n\\nMohamed Bouazizi was a street vendor in Sidi Bouzid, a governorate in central Tunisia where discrimination and bullying against those working in the informal economy remains a daily occurrence. Bouazizi was not exceptional in his daily struggles for economic survival and dignity. He was the norm, which is why he became an icon whose story resonated across the Middle East.\\n\\nBouazizi lived in an economically and ecologically stifling environment, with dusty, rocky, yellow land stretching as far as the eye can see. Where once a clement climate enabled abundant agricultural practices, there is now a desert pumped with conventional agriculture that exhausts the land from which it tries to produce. Where there was once a region fertile enough to feed the Roman empire, there is now a country that imports food and crops.\\n\\nA portrait of Mohamed Bouazizi is seen in Sidi Bouzid, Tunisia, on 27 October (AFP)\\n\\nAgriculture is an economic sector that yields little, particularly for the booming Tunisian youth. But then again, neither does any other sector, apart from tourism - which offers only limited and seasonal economic opportunities - or oil extraction in the southern part of the country. Both of these sectors require the ability of workers to move from one governorate to another, an opportunity often denied by the state for security reasons.\\n\\nThis leaves the informal economy as the most reasonable option, even though it is dangerous, unstable and offers no social protection. In a society where social recognition and validation comes with the gendered distribution of social roles, failing to make enough of a living to provide for a family is associated with failure and humiliation.\\n\\nThis humiliation comes at the hands of a state that speaks the language of paternalism but fails to deliver its benefits. It is a context that generates despair, anger and revolt, visually expressed through murals of martyrs and street graffiti in the urban and peri-urban centres where most youth live. The permeating atmosphere in Sidi Bouzid today is one in which life is exhausted or disregarded. Unsurprisingly, many youth there dream of mobility and emigration as a means to dignity.\\n\\nInternational markets\\n\\nWhen Bouazizi set himself on fire, he was revolting against an economic system that forced dereliction upon him. This system generates wealth for an elite fully integrated into the global economy, as a result of accrued capital that they invest abroad. It is a system that lacks fundamental resilience, because the most lucrative Tunisian sectors are destined to serve international markets while national food and water security remains lacking.\\n\\nIn such an economy, a person’s fate is not decided just at home, but on international markets. During the weeks preceding Bouazizi’s self-immolation, torrential rains cut Canada’s wheat harvest, while drought hit Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and China. In Argentina, a La Nina event caused crop failures for maize and soy.\\n\\nWarning to all tyrants: The Arab Spring lives on Read More »\\n\\nWith a diminished supply, prices for staple crops skyrocketed on international markets. Already at the time, Middle Eastern and North African countries imported more food per capita than any other region in the world, and the price volatility made the precarious social contracts between autocratic regimes and vulnerable populations untenable.\\n\\nA black swan emerged from precarity, abuse, floods, drought and economic interdependencies. Disruptions at one end of the globe resonated with devastating consequences at another. The shock was as abrupt as the ecological depletion was profound.\\n\\nIn our contemporary global economic system, which considers the environment as a simple externality, ecological limits are supposedly mitigated by the ability to trade. What a country cannot produce at home, it can import, provided its economy is diversified enough to incur the costs. But in a world defined by climate disruptions and the exhaustion of ecological capacity, economic shocks and supply-chain disruptions may well become the norm. In other words, the Arab Spring may have been an appetizer for the systemic cascading of risks and shocks to which our global governance and economic systems are not fit to respond.\\n\\nWater scarcity\\n\\nIt is no surprise that the Middle East became an early epicentre for the concentration of climate-related risks. It is among the global regions where the process of climate change started through the eroding of ecological functions. Carthaginian figs no longer exist because the soil that once produced them was systematically depleted.\\n\\nWhere land is exhausted, water becomes scarce and temperatures rise. With landscape change comes climate change. Add to this the rapid release of fossil energy through combustion since the start of the industrial era, and the plundering of ecosystems worldwide, and you get exponential climate change that becomes harder and harder to mitigate.\\n\\nSwitching away from fossil fuels to power economies is a necessary step for an effective climate transition, but it is insufficient. Regenerating the ecological functions of landscapes is the more profound and fundamental change needed to adapt to climate change and eventually stabilise the climate regime.\\n\\nA canal choked with sewage and garbage is pictured in Minya, Egypt (MEE/Mohamed Mahmoud)\\n\\nThis change is a tall order: it entails investing massively in activities that empower populations to tend to the land and its ability to retain water. This not a one-time fix; it should be the underpinning safety net of any human civilisation.\\n\\nYet, with today’s economic models, we operate under a different logic. Agriculture must be mechanised, scaled up and monocultured in order to be lucrative. In most countries, it relies on cheap and precarious labour to generate wealth, which concentrates in minority hands. Successful agricultural models embrace international markets before embracing local, resilient production.\\n\\nBeyond agriculture, we build human environments and extract energy while artificialising and depleting soils, draining water from aquifers and plundering biodiversity (where biodiversity is left). What we fail to realise is that by thinning the grounds upon which we rely, we thin our chances for survival and adaptiveness to shocks. 2010 and 2020 have that in common: They warned us of the impending consequences of our inattention to life and complexity.\\n\\nSystemic resilience\\n\\nSo, what is systemic resilience in a world where climate disruption, shocks and the interconnectedness of risks are about to accelerate - and where regions such as the Middle East are likely to suffer dangerous consequences?\\n\\nIt starts with ecological integrity. This requires massive investments in landscapes that regenerate the ability of the soil to store water and carbon, thanks to which countries can fight water scarcity at the root, rather than manage manmade scarcity. This requires empowering people to regenerate and tend to their own local resources, and investing in their labour capacity and in decentralised governance systems. It requires valuing regenerative agriculture and regenerative business models as the vessels of resilience and adaptiveness in a new type of economy.\\n\\nThis time around, progress should mean that we aim to stop breaking ground, and to start regenerating the one under our feet\\n\\nAt a time when our response to climate change is to shift energy systems and to digitalise our way towards a fourth industrial revolution, we fail to recognise that our responses follow the same logic that produced the climate crisis in the first place. If we follow this path only, resilience will entail further mechanisation of human activity; an illusory decoupling of economics from the natural world; technological solutions to support business as usual, as if environmental and climatic conditions did not exist; a systematisation of responses, regardless of human and ecological cultures; and a global economy that relies on the collectivisation of risks, independent of national and local abilities to handle them, and at the expense of the public good.\\n\\nThis logic will hold for a while, until it generates more shocks than the system can handle at once. The room for managing disasters will become ever smaller.\\n\\nThe history of the Middle East, and the most recent teachings of the Arab Spring, foretell our global future: ignore ecological integrity at your peril. This time around, progress should mean that we aim to stop breaking ground, and to start regenerating the one under our feet. In other words, humanity’s future lies in reconnecting with its origins: humus.\\n\\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.\\n\\nThis article is available in French on Middle East Eye French edition.',\n",
              " 'Like Jeremy Corbyn, any British politician who condemns Israel\\'s treatment of Palestinians risks being sucked into the vast, toxic sludge surrounding the issue of antisemitism\\n\\nThe day after Labour leader Keir Starmer suspended his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, from membership of the parliamentary Labour Party, the Daily Telegraph published an article headed \"Keir Starmer must go further...\" by freelance journalist Angela Epstein. It contained a new list of demands. \"It is not enough,\" wrote Epstein, \"that Jeremy Corbyn... has been suspended. Or that he has had the whip removed... He needs to be \\'sacked\\' as an MP. And booted out of parliament.\"\\n\\nThere is, of course, no legal mechanism for expelling Corbyn from parliament. He has committed no crime and was overwhelmingly re-elected by his constituents as recently as last December.\\n\\nNo matter; Epstein has a plan for overcoming this difficulty. She suggests that Starmer move an amendment to the Representation of the People Act, which for the moment only provides for the expulsion of sitting members sentenced to a year or more in prison.\\n\\nFor good measure, she also wants the former director of the National Council for Civil Liberties (Liberty), Shami Chakrabarti, who conducted an internal inquiry into the Labour Party\\'s handling of alleged antisemitism, to be expelled from the House of Lords, and Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, who made a fairly mild speech critical of Israel, subject to some unspecified \"censure\".\\n\\nWalking a fine line\\n\\nOther lobbyists have submitted to the Labour Party\\'s complaints department a list of 15 Labour MPs who they want to see purged. Some appear to regard criticism of Israel as evidence of antisemitism. The line is a fine one and, given the sensitivities, should be walked with care.\\n\\nAntisemitism report: By suspending Corbyn, Starmer is tearing Labour apart Read More »\\n\\nMany of those shouting loudest appear not to have read the Equality and Human Rights Commission\\'s report that triggered the recent uproar.\\n\\nAs Peter Oborne and Richard Sanders have pointed out in Middle East Eye, one of the report\\'s main criticisms of Labour\\'s internal processes appears to relate to the period when Corbyn\\'s sworn enemies were still in charge of the party machine. Oborne and Sanders even suggest that alleged interference by the leader\\'s office seems to refer to attempts by the leader\\'s office to discover why so little progress was being made.\\n\\nWhat is Corbyn\\'s offence? To be sure, he has over the years been unwise in some of the platforms he has shared and some of the company he has kept, but his principal offence is that he was the first leader of any major British political party not to be an unequivocal supporter of Israel.\\n\\nCorbyn\\'s election as Labour leader brought more than 200,000 new members into the Labour Party. Many were young idealists attracted by his evident authenticity; others were former Labour members who had left the party over previous disappointments, not least the Blair government\\'s support for the US invasion of Iraq.\\n\\nThe rise of Corbyn also attracted a small number of far-leftists whose views were not in tune with Labour values, and a relative handful of antisemites attracted by his record of support for the Palestinians. It is the latter who are the source of Labour\\'s recent woes, and Corbyn is not wrong when he says their activities have been blown out of all proportion by those who have a different agenda.\\n\\nSpeaking freely\\n\\nThis is not difficult to illustrate. According to Jennie Formby, a former Labour Party general secretary, many of the complaints of antisemitism received on her watch were levelled against people who turned out not to be members of the party. In the most serious cases, where people were successfully prosecuted for threatening or harassing a Jewish MP, the individuals concerned came from the far right or extreme left, although reporting of such cases rarely makes this clear.\\n\\nNaomi Wimborne-Idrissi has recently been suspended from membership of the Labour party\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is also apparent that Jewish Labour members who are supporters of Palestine and who dissent from the view that Corbyn is an antisemite have come under attack from other Jews. This, for example, is the experience of Naomi Wimborne-Idrissi who has suffered years of threats and abuse from fellow Jews.\\n\\nShe says: \"As a Jew on the left who is intensely anti-racist and intensely aware of what antisemitism is, to be called an antisemite myself is about as low as it gets and it undermines the fight against real antisemitism. This is one of the most frightening things. People have been weaponsising accusations which seriously undermines and endangers our chances of dealing with real antisemitism.\"\\n\\nMs Wimborne-Idrissi says that Jewish critics of Israel in the UK are denied the right to speak freely. \"We are being no-platformed, we are being cancelled, we are being denied the freedom to express legitimate points of view. People who care about civil liberties, human rights, freedom of speech... all these people should be up in arms about what is happening to Jeremy Corbyn and his associates in the Labour Party. So far they are silent.\"\\n\\nMs Wimborne-Idrissi has recently been suspended from membership of the Labour party, apparently for supporting Corbyn\\'s view that allegations of antisemitism in the Labour party have been exaggerated.\\n\\nAwards and apologies\\n\\nIn August 2018, the Daily Mail devoted several pages to trying to prove that four years earlier in Tunis, Corbyn had participated in a wreath-laying ceremony on the grave of one of the organisers of the 1972 massacre of Israeli Olympic athletes.\\n\\nIn fact, the only act of terrorism being commemorated was the 1985 bombing by the Israeli air force of the headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, in which somewhere between 50 and 70 people died, many of them Tunisians - an act of terrorism which even the then-British prime minister Margaret Thatcher condemned at the time.\\n\\nFormer Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn leaves his London home on 18 November (AFP)\\n\\nThe Jewish Chronicle, which has been at the forefront of the campaign against alleged antisemites in the Labour Party, has repeatedly been found by the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) to have published reports which were \"significantly misleading\". It has also been reprimanded by IPSO for obstructing its attempts to investigate complaints.\\n\\nIf party members were judged by the same criteria applied to Corbyn, then they, too, should be suspended\\n\\nThis past February, the paper paid substantial damages to Audrey White, a member of Liverpool Riverside Labour Party, who it had falsely claimed in four separate articles to have bullied Jewish Labour MP Louise Ellman. In September, it paid damages to a schoolteacher and Labour local councillor in Wokingham who was alleged to have launched \"a vicious protest\" that was \"suggestive of antisemitism\" against another Jewish Labour MP, Luciana Berger.\\n\\nNeedless to say, none of these awards and the subsequent apologies received the same publicity as the original allegations. Earlier this year, the paper went into voluntary liquidation, citing the impact of coronavirus. It has since been bought by a consortium which includes John Ware, the journalist who made a controversial BBC Panorama programme alleging widespread antisemitism in the Labour Party.\\n\\nWild exaggeration\\n\\nFor the avoidance of doubt, I repeat: no one is saying that there isn\\'t a problem - only that it has been wildly and wilfully exaggerated. Corbyn is not alone in believing this. According to an opinion poll conducted earlier this year by a company owned by a former Tory peer, Michael Ashcroft, 73 percent of Labour members believe this to be so. If party members were judged by the same criteria applied to Corbyn, then they, too, should be suspended.\\n\\n\\u200bHow top Labour officials plotted to bring down Jeremy Corbyn Read More »\\n\\nNo one should be in any doubt about the damage this is doing. In a 2019 poll commissioned by Greg Philo, a Glasgow academic, for a study by himself and other academics of Labour\\'s antisemitism crisis, 1,000 members of the public were asked: \"From what you have seen or heard, what percentage of Labour Party members do you think have had complaints of antisemitism made against them?\" The answers averaged 34 percent. The correct figure at the time was around 0.1 percent. According to Formby, one-third of the complaints made in 2019 came from a single individual.\\n\\nAs it happens, I am not a Corbyn supporter. I did not vote for him in either of the Labour leadership elections. I cannot claim to know him well, but I have been acquainted with him for almost 40 years, and I believe he is a thoroughly decent human being who has led a life according to his principles and it pains me greatly to see him traduced.\\n\\nOne of Corbyn\\'s most attractive features is that, although he has been on the receiving end of a great deal of abuse, he never responds in kind. For those who are wondering how so marginal a figure ever became the leader of Her Majesty\\'s Opposition, there is a simple answer: Iraq. This was an issue on which Corbyn\\'s judgment proved superior to that of his parliamentary colleagues. He was a leading member of the Stop the War campaign and, come the Labour leadership election, the organisation\\'s considerable social media resources were placed at his disposal. The rest is history.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s a trick\\'\\n\\nFor what it\\'s worth, my view of the case against Corbyn is as follows: he is a serial dissident who has spent a lifetime in opposition not only to his political enemies but to his own party. He has been on every picket line, attended every demonstration and signed just about every petition that has been put in front of him.\\n\\nHis remarkable success in the 2017 general election was achieved by promising everything to everybody and suggesting that someone else would pay for it - a formula which did not work so well in 2019. To govern is to compromise, to disappoint, to balance competing interests and decide between them. Corbyn has no experience in this. Had he by any chance stumbled into government, he would rapidly have proved a disappointment to his followers. That, not his views on Israel, is the main case against him.\\n\\nLabour leader Keir Starmer in the House of Commons on 7 October (UK Parliament/AFP)\\n\\nThe question arises as to what, if anything, can any mainstream British politician say about Israel\\'s treatment of Palestinians, without the risk of being sucked into the vast, toxic sludge that surrounds the issue of antisemitism?\\n\\nMaybe only an MP of Jewish origin can get away with criticising Israel without being denounced, and most choose not to. The late Sir Gerald Kaufman was one of a handful of exceptions, and he was denounced as a \"self-hating Jew\".\\n\\n\\'The wrong sort of Jew\\': How Labour pursued complaints against elderly Jewish opponents of Israel Read More »\\n\\nIn Israel itself, critics of the government routinely use words like \"apartheid\" to describe what is going on. An elderly Jewish physicist, Hajo Meyer, once remarked: \"An antisemite used to be a person who disliked Jews. Now it is a person who Jews dislike.\" Meyer could not be denounced because he was a survivor of Auschwitz. However, most non-Jews who criticise Israel run the risk of being labelled racists.\\n\\nIn a 2002 interview with Open Democracy, Shulamit Aloni, former Israeli education minister, was asked why those who express dissent against policies of the Israeli government are labelled as antisemites.\\n\\nShe replied: \"Well, it\\'s a trick. We always use it. When from Europe somebody is criticising Israel, then we bring up the Holocaust. When in [the US] people are criticising Israel, then they are antisemitic... It\\'s very easy to blame people who criticise certain acts of the Israeli government as antisemitic, and to bring up the Holocaust, and the suffering of the Jewish people, [to] justify everything we do to the Palestinians.\"\\n\\nA pragmatic view\\n\\nIf it is a trick, it appears to be working. There is a pragmatic view among many British politicians that says the subject should simply be dropped - that it is just too difficult and, in any case, a distraction from more important matters closer to home.\\n\\nThe Tories, who traditionally have had much more of a problem than Labour with anti-Jewish prejudice, clearly take this view. Notice how quiet they are. I was surprised to read last year that around 80 percent of Conservative MPs were members of the Conservative Friends of Israel. When I put this to a Tory MP friend, he just smiled and said that all Tory MPs were encouraged to do so. I guess it\\'s an insurance policy.\\n\\nBritish Foreign Office ministers greet each new excess with bland statements urging all sides to be nice to each other\\n\\nShould Labour members follow the Tory example and just shut up? I beg to differ. Israel is in the process of setting up an apartheid state, and we ought to be allowed to talk about it. The West Bank is being colonised, in defiance of international law; East Jerusalem is in the process of being ethnically cleansed; Gaza is a bantustan.\\n\\nIn a single day in May 2018, Israeli troops killed 60 Palestinian youths demonstrating near the fence that separates Gaza from Israel and inflicted life-changing injuries on many more. Sixty is about the same number of fatalities as those gunned down in Sharpeville by South African troops in March 1960, an incident that sent shockwaves around the world and is remembered to this day. By contrast, Israel\\'s killing of a similar number in a single day in Gaza was briefly reported and then forgotten.\\n\\nA recent BBC programme reported that over the last 15 years, offshore companies belonging to the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich have donated $100m to the Israeli settler group Elad, which is buying up property in East Jerusalem with a view to expelling Palestinian residents, some of whom have lived there for generations.\\n\\nDozens of Palestinian households reportedly have eviction notices hanging over them. In one case, in July 2019, a woman and her four adult children were evicted after a 24-year legal battle. Elad, the settler group, has also been digging tunnels under Palestinian houses, ostensibly as part of an archaeology project, causing subsidence.\\n\\nEach year in May, in an event reminiscent of Loyalist marches through the Catholic enclaves of Belfast, several thousand flag-waving Israelis march through the Arab Quarter of Jerusalem, celebrating the 1967 annexation of East Jerusalem, an act recognised by no other countries except the United States and Guatemala.\\n\\nSwitching off\\n\\nNone of this causes much more than a ripple in the outside world. British Foreign Office ministers greet each new excess with bland little statements urging all sides to be nice to each other. From US governments, Democratic or Republican, comes unequivocal support. The Israeli lobby in the US is so well-organised that few in Congress dare raise the subject.\\n\\nOne difficulty for outsiders is that there are few heroes on either side. It was said of the late Yasser Arafat that he never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity. The leaders of Hamas, which rules Gaza, do not appear to care about their people. They allow their militants to fire rockets into Israel. They encourage Palestinian youths to throw stones at Israeli soldiers in the certain knowledge that many of them will be gunned down.\\n\\nThey do so apparently in the belief that the inevitably disproportionate retaliation will incur public sympathy abroad. They ought to have learned by now that it won\\'t.\\n\\nHow Israel\\'s propaganda war has silenced Europe Gideon Levy Read More »\\n\\nIs it any wonder that many good people switch off? As my old friend, veteran journalist Wilf Burchett, who had reported from wars and revolutions all over the world, was fond of saying: \"Every morning I get up and thank God that he never made me an expert on the Middle East.\"\\n\\nOne doesn\\'t envy Starmer in having to deal with all of this. None of it is of his making. One of his first acts on becoming leader was to settle a series of outstanding libel actions brought against the party from former party officials who were featured in the Panorama documentary denouncing Corbyn and claiming to be whistleblowers.\\n\\nThe settlement has spared them the embarrassment of having to explain the huge tranche of leaked internal emails that reveal the extent of their hostility to the leadership of the party that employed them. Labour\\'s lawyers advised that, if the case had gone to court, the party stood a good chance of winning, but libel is an expensive game and the case might have dragged on for years, distracting attention from other issues.\\n\\nOne can\\'t blame Starmer for wanting to draw a line under it, but has he?

One lawyer for several litigants has been quoted as saying: \"If this bankrupts the Labour Party... so be it.\"\\n\\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.',\n",
              " \"While some believe the uprisings of 2010-11 were a failure - the ferocity of the counter-revolution suggests otherwise\\n\\nA decade ago, a young Tunisian, Mohamed Bouazizi, set himself on fire to protest his economic and social conditions, sparking a series of Arab uprisings and revolutions. It later became known as the Arab Spring and led to the downfall of Arab dictators in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen.\\n\\nWhile some believe the Arab Spring failed to achieve its goals, particularly the establishment of free and democratic governments, there were many gains, including the ousting of the heads of four powerful authoritarian regimes: Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in Tunisia, Hosni Mubarak in Egypt, Muammar Gaddafi in Libya, and Ali Abdullah Saleh in Yemen.\\n\\nThe events of the past decade have revealed that the costs of authoritarianism and rejecting political change are very high - but those regimes that block reform are willing to pay a heavy price to remain in power.\\n\\nSponsors of the counter-revolution\\n\\nThis is certainly the case in Syria, which has been destroyed due to President Bashar al-Assad’s refusal to respond to demands for change. There no longer exists a sovereign state that he can govern, since Syria has come under the protection and tutelage of foreign powers, in particular Iran and Russia.\\n\\nSimilarly, the costs of General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s coup in Egypt in 2013 were very high. He has become known in the international arena as the worst dictator in the Middle East. He also has been forced to sacrifice some of Egypt’s regional weight in order to appease his allies, including the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Israel.\\n\\nArab Spring 2.0: Five lessons from 2011 for today's protesters Read More »\\n\\nThe sponsors of the counter-revolution, in particular the UAE and Saudi Arabia, spent large sums of money to stop the Arab Spring and to ensure that the protests would not reach them and unseat them from their thrones. They are now involved in civil wars in Yemen and Libya, financing mercenaries and warlords, such as General Khalifa Haftar. Their international reputations have reached a new low amid the killing of children and civilians in Yemen.\\n\\nThe ferocity of the counter-revolution itself might be the most important evidence of the success of the Arab Spring in achieving its goals, the chief of which was to raise the costs of tyranny. The UAE, Egypt and Saudi Arabia are trying to stop Arab revolutions and uprisings from recurring at any cost.\\n\\nThe economic aid provided to Sisi by Abu Dhabi and Riyadh has reportedly exceeded $60bn, not to mention the arms deals signed with France, Italy, Russia and the US. Political support has also been provided to Sisi to improve his image in Washington through lobby groups. The Emirati ambassador to Washington, Yousef Al Otaiba, played a pivotal role in marketing the 2013 Egyptian coup to the US administration.\\n\\nAnother wave of uprisings\\n\\nThe experience of the Arab Spring revealed that, despite the power of security and intelligence services - and their use of all means of torture, murder and violation of human rights for the sake of intimidation - the structure of Arab despotism is subject to breakage.\\n\\nWho could have imagined that the Mubarak regime, which lasted for 30 years, would fall in a matter of 18 days? Who would have thought that Libya’s Gaddafi would be found hiding in a hole a few months after the revolution was launched against him, or that Yemen’s Saleh would face the same fate, killed in a hideous manner after three decades of rule?\\n\\nSudanese protesters arrive in the town of Atbara on 19 December 2019 (AFP)\\n\\nPerhaps it is ironic that despite the continuing attempts by counter-revolutionary forces to abort the Arab Spring, the hopes for democracy are still alive.\\n\\nThe Arab Spring has become a reference for Arab youth who dream of freedom, dignity and justice - and who will not stop until they realise that dream\\n\\nAccording to the 2019-2020 Arab Opinion Index, the largest annual survey in the Arab world conducted by the Arab Centre for Research and Policy Studies, about 74 percent of Arabs believe that democracy is the most appropriate system of governance for their home countries.\\n\\nMoreover, the Arab region has witnessed another wave of uprisings and revolutions over the past two years, including Sudan, Algeria, Iraq and Lebanon. Throngs of demonstrators have taken to the streets to demand economic, social and political change.\\n\\nFormer Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, who was in power for more than 30 years, was overthrown, and former Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika resigned after massive demonstrations. Iraqi and Lebanese people rose up in protest against corruption and sectarianism, and to reject the domination of external forces over internal political decisions.\\n\\nMany segments of Egyptian society also rose up in late 2019 to demand improvements in their social and economic conditions, despite the severe repression deployed by the Sisi regime.\\n\\nPolitical and ideological divisions\\n\\nYet, any objective assessment of the Arab Spring experience must take into account the mistakes made by the political and revolutionary movements that were meant to lead Arab societies after the fall of authoritarian regimes.\\n\\nThese actors have suffered from political and ideological divisions, particularly between Islamists and secularists, and have been preoccupied with identity issues, such as the relationship between religion and the state. Often, these divisions have come at the expense of more urgent issues, such as improving economic and social conditions, eliminating corruption and addressing unemployment.\\n\\nMore than ever, the struggle for justice unites the Middle East and the world Read More »\\n\\nThe polarisation among these forces not only disrupted the potential for democratic transition but also led to the return of old regimes, as in Egypt.\\n\\nEgypt’s Muslim Brotherhood failed in governance due to a lack of experience in managing state affairs, and as a result of the forces of the old regime plotting against them. The gap of mistrust widened, and secular movements chose to ally with the military in order to get rid of the Muslim Brotherhood. This Islamic-secular division still plays an important role in sustaining Egypt’s political crisis seven years after the coup.\\n\\nPolitical movements also failed to rebuild civil-military relations, to build civilian capacity within them, and to remove the military from political life. This failure allowed the military establishment to retain great influence in key sectors, contributing to its return to power, as in Egypt. Militaries succeeded in deceiving opposing political forces; they have been key partners in managing transitions, as in Sudan.\\n\\nSimultaneously, the forces of the Mubarak regime - especially the military generals - remained in full contact and coordination with regional counter-revolutionary forces in Abu Dhabi, Riyadh and Tel Aviv, as well as with the West, especially the US, aiming to seize power again under the pretext of restoring stability and combating terrorism.\\n\\nYearning for freedom\\n\\nTen years have passed since the Arab Spring, and despite attempts to silence the Arab peoples, large sectors - especially youth - continue to yearn for freedom, dignity and justice. The clearest evidence of this is that any time the fighting stops in Syria, peaceful protesters emerge to express their rejection of Assad and to demand his departure from power. Likewise, in Egypt, there is increasing criticism directed at Sisi on a daily basis, whether on social networks or through protests that occur from time to time, despite Sisi’s iron fist.\\n\\nSeveral years ago, no one would have dared to criticise Sisi, whether in private or in public. Social media is now rife with insults and accusations against him, his family and those close to him - accusations of corruption and abuse of power for financial gain for himself and his family.\\n\\nWhat is striking about the Arab Spring story is the political and moral bankruptcy of the West\\n\\nSisi has inserted the Egyptian army into all fields of the economy, angering many segments of society, especially the businessmen who supported him strongly when he came to power after the 2013 coup.\\n\\nWith Sisi shutting down all outlets of expression, and amid the state’s continued use of violence and repression against opponents, the situation will likely explode in his face sooner or later.\\n\\nAt the same time, what is striking about the Arab Spring story is the political and moral bankruptcy of the West. While western governments give others lessons on respecting democracy, their own behaviour over the past decade has achieved the opposite. Western governments failed to support the democratic transition processes in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia and Yemen, instead supporting Arab authoritarian regimes that were hostile towards the Arab Spring.\\n\\nRealising the dream\\n\\nThe US and European governments are colluding with authoritarian regimes in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain. The most important evidence has been their shameful silence on Sisi’s 2013 coup, as well as their failure to condemn the horrific human rights violations in the country.\\n\\nThese governments also colluded with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who was behind the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018 at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. They are silent on bin Salman’s arrests of dozens of journalists, businessmen, religious scholars and political activists.\\n\\nThey have continued to profit from the war in Yemen that resulted from the uprising against the Saudi-backed candidate to replace Ali Abdullah Saleh.\\n\\nThe 'revolution fist', a symbol of Lebanon's uprising, is pictured in Beirut on 22 October (AFP)\\n\\nWestern countries have prioritised arms deals and investments over human rights and democracy in the Arab world. Perhaps one of the most important lessons for the Arab peoples over the past decade is not to depend on external support in order to confront authoritarian regimes and to establish democracy.\\n\\nThe outcomes of the Arab Spring may seem meagre in comparison to the sacrifices made in Egypt, Libya, Syria or Yemen. But the inescapable fact is that the Arab Spring has become a reference for Arab youth who dream of freedom, dignity and justice - and who will not stop until they realise that dream.\\n\\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.\",\n",
              " 'Israel\\'s outrageous fabrications about the immigration of Arab Jews to Israel in the 1940s and 50s are an attempt to mask the injustices meted out to Palestinians\\n\\nIsraeli propaganda about the \"expulsion\" of Arab Jews from Arab countries in the late 1940s and early 1950s continues without respite. Earlier this month, Israel\\'s UN ambassador, Gilad Erdan, informed UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres that he \"intends to submit a draft resolution requiring the international body to hold an annual commemoration for the hundreds of thousands of Jews exiled from Arab countries due to the creation of the State of Israel,\" according to a report in Ynet.\\n\\nThe history of Arab Jewish immigration to Israel is not one of expulsion by Arab regimes, but rather one of Israeli criminal actions and conspiracies\\n\\nIsrael\\'s fabrications about the immigration of Arab Jews to Israel are so outrageous that the country holds a commemoration on 30 November each year. This date just happens to coincide with the ethnic cleansing by Zionist gangs of Palestine, which began on 30 November 1947, a day after the UN General Assembly adopted the Partition Plan. The choice of date seeks to implicate Arab Jews in the conquest of Palestine, when most had no role in it.\\n\\nErdan alleges that, after the establishment of the Israeli settler-colony, Arab countries \"launched a widespread attack against the State of Israel and the thriving Jewish communities that lived within [the Arab world]\". Israeli fabrications, with which Israel always hoped to force Arab countries into paying Israel billions of dollars, have a second important goal: to exonerate Israel from its original sin of expelling Palestinians in 1948 and stealing their land and property.\\n\\nIdeological pitfalls\\n\\nIn December 1948, the UN General Assembly mandated that Palestinian refugees be allowed to return home and that they be compensated for the destruction and theft of their property by Israel. Israel not only wants to hold on to all of those lands, but to extort Arab countries to pay out billions more.\\n\\nThere is a further irony to the Israeli ploy: Israel has always insisted that Palestine, and later Israel, is the homeland of world Jewry, while simultaneously claiming that Arab Jews who immigrated to Israel are \"refugees\". The legal and internationally accepted definition of a refugee, however, is of a person who was expelled or fled their homeland, not one who \"returns\" to their homeland.\\n\\nPresident of the Egyptian Jewish Community Magda Shehata Haroun at the Shaar Hashamayim Synagogue in Cairo on 3 October, 2013 (AFP)\\n\\nThese ideological pitfalls aside, the history of Arab Jewish emigration to Israel is not one of expulsion by Arab regimes, but rather one of Israeli criminal actions that forced Jews in Yemen, Iraq, Morocco, Egypt and other countries to leave for Israel.\\n\\nIn 1949, the Israeli government was working assiduously with British colonial authorities in Aden and with Yemeni officials to airlift Yemeni Jews to Israel. While the League of Arab States had resolved to ban the emigration of Arab Jews to Israel, Yemen\\'s imam allowed Jews to leave as early as February 1949, with the help of Zionist emissaries and Israeli bribes to provincial Yemeni rulers, according to prominent Israeli historian Tom Segev\\'s book: 1949: The First Israelis.\\n\\nSome provincial rulers asked that at least 2,000 Jews remain, as it was the religious duty of Muslims to protect them, but the Zionist emissary insisted that it was a Jewish religious \"commandment\" for them to go to the \"Land of Israel\". The fact that Israel\\'s prime minister at the time was David Ben Gurion also suggested to many that Israel \"was the kingdom of David,\" according to Segev and other sources. Tens of thousands of Jews were urged to leave their homes and travel to Israel.\\n\\nInstitutionalised discrimination\\n\\nAs for the Jews who opted to stay, the Jewish emissary in Aden, Shlomo Schmidt, asked permission to propose that Yemeni authorities expel them, but Yemeni authorities did not.\\n\\nSome of the luggage of the departing Jews, including ancient Torah scrolls, jewellery and embroidered garments, which they were encouraged to bring with them, disappeared en route and mysteriously \"made their way to antique and souvenir shops in Israel,\" according to Segev and other sources.\\n\\nAbout 50,000 Yemeni Jews were essentially removed from Yemen by the Israelis in 1949 and 1950 to face institutionalised Ashkenazi discrimination in Israel. This included the abduction of hundreds of Yemeni children from their parents, who were told the children died; the children were then allegedly handed over for adoption to Ashkenazi couples.\\n\\nArab rulers and Israel\\'s leaders: A long and secret history of cooperation Read More »\\n\\nZionists were also active in bringing about the emigration of Morocco\\'s Jews to Israel. Morocco was under French colonial occupation at the time, so the Jewish Agency had to strike an agreement with the French governor of Morocco to bring about the emigration of Moroccan Jews, who had to face horrific conditions on Israeli ships, according to Segev and other sources. Some of the 100,000 Jews who left, according to the Jewish Agency emissary, had to be virtually \"taken aboard the ships by force\".\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Iraqi government of Nuri al-Said, Britain\\'s strongman in the Arab east, was maligned by Israeli propaganda that it was persecuting Jews, when in fact these were Israeli fabrications. Zionist agents had been active in Iraq, smuggling Jews through Iran to Israel, which led to the prosecution of a handful of Zionists.\\n\\nThen, attacks on Iraqi Jews began, including at the Masuda Shemtov synagogue in Baghdad, killing four Jews and wounding around a dozen more. Some Iraqi Jews believed that this was the work of Mossad agents, aiming to scare Jews into leaving the country. Iraqi authorities accused and executed two activists from the Zionist underground.\\n\\nAmid Israel\\'s global campaign to pressure Iraq into allowing Jews to leave - which led to Israeli attempts to block a World Bank loan to Iraq, accompanied by American and British pressure - the Iraqi parliament relented and issued a law permitting Jews to leave. Zionist agents in Iraq telegraphed their handler in Tel Aviv: \"We are carrying on our usual activity in order to push the law through faster.\" Iraq\\'s 120,000 Jews were thus soon transferred to Israel.\\n\\nTargeting western interests\\n\\nAmong Egypt\\'s relatively small Jewish community, an even smaller number were Ashkenazi (mostly from Alsace and Russia) who arrived since the 1880s. The larger community consisted of Sephardi Jews who arrived during the same period from Turkey, Iraq and Syria, in addition to the tiny community of Karaite Jews. All in all, they numbered fewer than 70,000 people, half of whom did not hold Egyptian nationality.\\n\\nZionist activism among the small community of Ashkenazi Jews in Egypt led some to go to Palestine before 1948. However, it was after the establishment of Israel that many of Egypt\\'s upper-class Jews began to leave to France, not Israel. Nonetheless, the community remained essentially intact until Israel intervened in 1954, recruiting Egyptian Jews for an Israeli terrorist cell that placed bombs in Egyptian cinemas, the Cairo train station as well as American and British educational institutions and libraries.\\n\\nThe Israelis hoped that by targeting western interests in Egypt, they could sour the then-friendly relations between Egypt\\'s president and the Americans.\\n\\nEgyptian intelligence uncovered the Israeli terrorist ring and tried the accused in open court. The Israelis mounted an international campaign against Egypt and president Gamal Abdel Nasser, who was dubbed \"Hitler on the Nile\" by the Israeli and western press, while Israeli agents shot at the Egyptian consulate in New York, according to David Hirst\\'s book The Gun and the Olive Branch and other sources.\\n\\nWhen Israel joined the British-French conspiracy to invade Egypt in 1956, and after its military occupation of the Sinai Peninsula, public rage ensued against the settler-colony\\n\\nCombined with the new socialist and nationalist campaign of Egyptianising investments in the country, many rich businessmen began to sell their businesses and leave.\\n\\nBy the time nationalisation began in the late 1950s and early 1960s, most of the nationalised businesses were in fact owned by Egyptian Muslims and Christians, not Jews. It was in this context, and in the context of public rage against Israel, that many Egyptian Jews got scared and left after 1954 to the US and France, while the poor ended up in Israel (as recounted in Joel Beinin\\'s Dispersion of Egyptian Jewry).\\n\\nWhen Israel joined the British-French conspiracy to invade Egypt in 1956, and after its military occupation of the Sinai Peninsula, public rage ensued against the settler-colony. The Egyptian government detained about 1,000 Jews, half of whom were Egyptian citizens, according to Beinin, and Egypt\\'s small Jewish community began to leave in droves. On the eve of Israel\\'s second invasion of Egypt in 1967, only 7,000 Jews remained in the country.\\n\\nFormal invitations\\n\\nDespite Israeli culpability in bringing about the exodus of Arab Jews from their countries, the Israeli government continues to blame it on Arab governments. As for the property of Arab Jews, indeed, they should be fully entitled to it and/or to compensation - not on account of some fabricated expulsion narrative that serves the interests of the Israeli state, but on account of their actual ownership.\\n\\nContrary to Israeli propaganda that there was a population swap, it is notable that while European and Arab Jews who emigrated to Israel were given the stolen land and properties of expelled Palestinians free of charge, according to Israeli historian Benny Morris and other sources, the Palestinians did not receive the property of the Arab Jews who migrated to Israel.\\n\\nA picture dated before 1937 during the British Mandate in Palestine shows Arabs demonstrating in the Old City of Jerusalem against the Jewish immigration to Palestine (AFP)\\n\\nIndeed, the Palestine Liberation Organization, which in 1974 received recognition by the Arab League and the UN as \"the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people,\" was very aware of this Israeli strategy. Understanding that the emigration of Arab Jews to Israel was a boon to the Israeli settler-colony, the PLO demanded, in a much-publicised 1975 memorandum to the Arab governments whose Jewish populations had left to Israel, that they issue formal and public invitations for Arab Jews to return home.\\n\\nNotably, none of the governments and regimes in power in 1975 were in office when the Jews left between 1949 and 1967. Public and open invitations were duly issued by the governments of Morocco, Yemen, Libya, Sudan, Iraq and Egypt for Arab Jews to return home, especially in light of the institutionalised Ashkenazi racist discrimination to which they had been subjected in Israel. Neither Israel nor its Arab Jewish communities heeded the calls.\\n\\nRewarding crimes\\n\\nAll this aside, there is the matter of Israel\\'s unceasing attempts to equate the financial losses of Arab Jews with those of Palestinian refugees. A conservative official Israeli estimate comparing Palestinian property losses to Arab Jewish property losses gave a ratio of 22 to one in favour of Palestinians - despite Israel\\'s gross overestimation of Arab Jewish losses and even grosser underestimation of Palestinian losses.\\n\\nHow the Arab League helped dissolve the Palestinian question Read More »\\n\\nResearchers\\' conservative estimates of Palestinian refugee losses amount to more than $300bn in 2008 prices, excluding damages for psychological pain and suffering, which would raise the total substantially. This excludes the losses in confiscated land and property for Palestinian citizens of Israel since 1948, and the losses incurred by Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem since 1967.\\n\\nWhereas none of the Arab regimes in power when Arab Jews emigrated to Israel exists today, the same Israeli colonial-settler regime that expelled the Palestinian people and engineered the exodus of Arab Jews from their countries remains in power.\\n\\nYet, in his letter, Erdan complains that \"it is infuriating to see the UN mark a special day and devote a lot of resources for the issue of \\'Palestinian refugees,\\' while abandoning and ignoring hundreds of thousands of Jewish families deported from Arab countries and Iran\". The irony of Erdan\\'s letter is that it demands that the Israeli regime be financially and morally rewarded for the crimes it has committed over the last seven decades.\\n\\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.\\n\\nThis article is available in French on Middle East Eye French edition.',\n",
              " 'From not fighting back against the racism of my teacher to refusing to play a part in the war on terror\\n\\nEditor\\'s Note: This essay, published under the title \\'The Duty to See, the Yearning to be Seen,\\' is an extract from I Refuse to Condemn: Resisting Racism in Times of National Security, edited by Asim Qureshi and published by Manchester University Press.\\n\\nOn a cold winter\\'s night, my mother took my brother and me to a hospital on the other side of Berlin. It was the early months of the Second Intifada, when the majority of Palestinians were killed or maimed in demonstrations. I was told Germany had flown in two Palestinian youths who required immediate medical attention.\\n\\nWe entered their room quietly, not to disturb whatever peace was found among flickering lights and pale, dry walls. The older adolescent - 18 years old perhaps, my brother\\'s age - was awake, while the younger one slept in a separate chamber.\\n\\nI remember the emptiness in the room, and wondered if anyone else but my mother knew of their stay. She stood by the older adolescent\\'s bedside and they conversed. My Arabic was Egyptian-manageable, so I only grasped fragments of a story told in a Palestinian dialect.\\n\\nMy mother, keen as she was of my limitations, translated fragments of the story. The boy in the other room, she told me, was my age - 14. He had been shot in the leg.\\n\\nBefore leaving, my mother pressed a finger to her lips and took us into the other room to witness the sleeping child. A strange assemblage of beams and bandages enclosed his leg. I remember thanking God he was asleep.\\n\\nI wondered what it felt like to be shot; why anyone would want to shoot a child; what the cost of a leg really was. Most of all, I wondered if it was worth visiting someone who was asleep, in an empty room, with no one to remember the event but ourselves. I realise now that was the point. My mother died suddenly not long after that hospital visit.\\n\\nBerlin\\'s military hospital, where Tarek Younis was taken by his mother to meet Palestinian teens injured during the Second Intifada (Creative Commons)\\n\\n\\n\\nMy mother taught me the responsibility to see, pitted against our very nature to be seen. When we ask ourselves how we have gotten here, that hospital room\\'s sombre and gazeless silence has always struck me as important.\\n\\nIn a book on the value and refusal of condemnation, my story will ultimately revolve around the angst of being ill-seen or, worse, not being seen at all. It is, then, ultimately a story of cowardice and I write this for those who, like me, are cowards. We must remember that it is only through fear that one learns to be brave.\\n\\nThe focus of this essay, then, is on sight. I draw on my experiences, where the gaze of others constitutes the means and the end of my efforts. My story will be shared in segments, with different moments unveiling different sides of an experience. I will look at that terrible marriage of cowardice and silence, each begetting the other. It is one thing to not condemn, it is another to know that my silence and the fear to \"condemn condemnation\" is born of an ever-present desire to remain seen.\\n\\nThe marriage of cowardice and silence\\n\\nMy school in Berlin was privileged by its demographics, which were white and middle class. Almost everyone I knew took their education seriously. I was the only Muslim in my year.\\n\\nPolitical science was not a course I enjoyed. At the time, in the early 2000s, it was an endless exhibition of the EU and its hegemony, which meant questioning that dreaded potential of Turkey\\'s joining. It was obvious that the subject was of the teacher\\'s choosing. She appeared stuck on the Muslim question, always interrogating the place of Muslims in Western society.\\n\\nA photograph of Tarek Younis as a teenager in Germany (Supplied)\\n\\nOne day, completely out of the blue, my political science teacher requested I stay behind after class. I was unsure what to expect: I would get into trouble for clowning around anywhere, but I was particularly quiet in her class. I waited for the class to empty then, without warning, she approached and admitted she didn\\'t want people like me in her neighbourhood.\\n\\nI nodded unthinkingly, unsure if it was to bring an end to our interaction or to give her the assurance she sought.\\n\\nI immediately recounted the experience to my English teacher. We were close and I knew she understood the gravity of the situation. As expected, she turned crimson and ran off, keen, I\\'m sure, on finding some retribution on my behalf. Whatever she found, I never saw.\\n\\nSo far, my tale is but one iteration of a post-9/11 tale told countless times. It turned otherworldly soon after, however. Frustrated, I shared my story with a Muslim friend outside of school. We rarely spoke and, as fate would have it, he told me his teacher had recently told him the same thing. We laughed about this odd synchronisation of racist teachers across Berlin, and I found solace in the divine coincidence.\\n\\nThen my friend admitted he punched his teacher in the face.\\n\\nI was taken aback, unsure of myself. I was angry at my teacher as well, of course, but this emotion had amounted to very little. I felt embarrassed, not because I didn\\'t consider violence as an option, but because this fated phone call inspired a harsh revelation: I may not punch, but I learned it was fear, not good manners, which saw me shirk from conflict.\\n\\nI felt I was suddenly forced into a conversation with an alternate version of \"me\" whose dimension split at the moment of injury. A me who didn\\'t bow so quickly to oppression, as unwise and unethical as the fist may be. A me who had the courage and creativity to find retribution, beyond the meagre choices set before me.\\n\\nMy friend surely took notice of my unease and filled the silence. My teacher was a woman, he joked, and after all it was only correct to punch men. I didn\\'t tell him all I knew to do with anger, any confidence I had, was to bottle it in; perhaps arbitrarily displace a portion of it onto an English teacher, which I knew would amount to nothing. I didn\\'t tell him I didn\\'t even have the heart to disagree with my teacher. I didn\\'t tell him I just found out I was a coward.\\n\\nI waited for the class to empty then, without warning, she approached and admitted she didn\\'t want people like me in her neighbourhood\\n\\nI wanted to be seen, but I feared the unwelcoming, rejecting gaze, so pronounced in moments of conflict. So, I remained catatonic for the remainder of the two years I had with this political science teacher. I had forgotten the face of my mother by then. She would have reminded me the other\\'s gaze mattered very little.\\n\\nIn the end, political science pulled my marks low. Despite attempts to make up for it in other classes, my final GPA (grade point average) ensured I couldn\\'t enter my programme of choice at any university in Berlin.\\n\\nOutside of goodness\\n\\nThe question of why it is difficult to refuse condemnation misses the wood for the trees. My self-interrogation would rather invert the question on its head: why is the approval of others so alluring? For Muslims across the Global North, the want to condemn terror is salient, but it is only one account of a want to be seen.\\n\\nThe war on terror needs no introduction, but insofar as it reflects a dynamic process - fluid, intangible - I need to briefly give my account of it. The war on terror stands at the intersection of two of the greatest ideologies of our time: capitalism and the global military-industrial complex, on the one hand; and nationalism and the management of belonging, on the other. I refer to both ideologies as \"Power\" throughout this chapter.\\n\\nNaturally, Muslims have a special relationship with the war on terror. On the one hand, obstructing the war industry\\'s relentless march against evil is akin to standing outside of goodness itself. To stand and resist the war is to be made to feel as if you’re on the side of terror. On the other hand, not exalting the nation is to stand outside the boundaries of the \"populace\". To stand against the nation-state is to render all suspicions true - that you, in fact, do not belong. In both ideologies, to be seen (as in accepted) by Power has immense benefits - material and incorporeal.\\n\\nBecoming the \\'good\\' Muslim\\n\\nI moved to Montreal after high school, leaving behind any discoveries I made of myself or Power, wandering further away from my mother’s wisdom. I remained inclined towards do-gooding nonetheless and saw myself as a \"Muslim activist\". But the desire to be seen features in even the most principled of intents.\\n\\nI engaged fervently in both community activities, on the one hand - especially those relating to Muslim youth, which led me down a path of clinical psychology - and political activism that was both domestic and international, on the other. I separate Muslim and politics here because, of course, such are the terms of \"good\" Muslims. I remember distinctly the backlash I received as president of the Muslim Students\\' Association when I suggested we should be at the forefront of a movement on Palestinian rights - \"the MSA is not political,\" I was told.\\n\\nThe attention given to me for becoming a Muslim male psychologist, by both Muslims and Power alike, was tremendous. Western psychology is a particular artefact of Power - a secular theology of sorts - and Muslim representation within it is highly coveted. My background and experience in working with the Muslim community, especially youth groups, suddenly saw incredible overlap with Power\\'s desire to pacify the very distress it causes by \"soothing from within\".\\n\\nPower always creates lucrative openings for everyone to enter its good grace as long as they play by its rules, and I was well on my way to becoming a psychologist who knows and plays his role. Representation is key in this process of pacification, and who better than a Muslim psychologist, who represents an ideal of secular sanctity (mental health professionals as secular priests of the soul) and diversity politics?\\n\\nOne is not allowed anger, of course, because the experience of anger, even if righteous, cannot exist outside Power\\'s gaze. The refusal to condemn, then, is a refusal of existing wholly in the gaze of Power\\n\\nIn a few short years, like others blessed with both opportunity and privilege, I was suddenly being invited to consult on clinical and social issues pertaining to Western Muslims. Luckily, I had incredibly astute mentors who offered as much guidance and critical literature as I could digest (especially questioning psychology’s relationship to Power). And yet, even then with all this critical reflection, I still remained convinced of that age-old maxim of Power: \"If you want to make a change, join us and change it from within.\"\\n\\nI soon began consulting for the Montreal police, as part of a special committee which discussed Muslim/Arab concerns. It was not uncommon to discuss issues regarding terrorism/radicalisation in these meetings. When they arose, the narrative remained static: yes, there are \"bad Muslims\" out there, but there are \"good Muslims\" (especially in the room) who were model citizens.\\n\\nOur model-ness, our very presence, was the physical manifestation of condemnation. I held my misgivings at this thought, though I learned to assert (and failed at asserting) my apprehension at other times. Most of all, I learned that silence was an act with its own incalculable reward. This gift revealed itself at US–Canada border control.\\n\\nThe privilege of goodness\\n\\nMy cousin and I planned a road trip to New York. He was a football player who travels for training, including to Turkey. Naturally, we were held up as we crossed the northern border. As the hours passed, my cousin and I joked how the officer was checking his information under the \"sports\" page - surely \"travels to Turkey for football\" is flagged for suspicion.\\n\\nBut the officer then returned my cousin\\'s documents and it turned out it was me all along. I was the cause of our wait.\\n\\nA letter from Montreal police, which Tarek Younis says he was encouraged to carry with him every time he travelled to the US (Supplied)\\u200b\\n\\nI began questioning the cause of our delay as we entered the second hour. The agent didn\\'t give an explanation. He said he still needed to check the system.\\n\\n\"Do you think someone who consults for the Montreal police would be a problem?\" I asked, frustrated.\\n\\nThe agent looked up from his monitor. \"Prove it.\"\\n\\nIncidentally, I had just the evidence: a letter of recommendation on my phone from one of the assistant directors of the Montreal police. I showed it to the agent. He took the phone in his hand, stared it at it for a moment, and returned it.\\n\\n\"You should carry this with you every time you cross,\" he said. He handed back all our papers and we drove off.\\n\\nMy cousin and I laughed as we drove off into the Catskill Mountains. But I felt ashamed: this was not how my parents raised me. What of those who never had a letter? How do they fare, stripped of privilege?\\n\\nUntil today, I continuously receive offers to aid the war on terror, in some form or another. I\\'m a Muslim, male, clinical psychologist who specialises in the cultural and political dimensions of mental health; I have a long background of working with vulnerable youth within the Muslim community and social issues more broadly; I have a research background in Islamophobia and civic engagement. These are all highly desirable qualities for Power, especially given the number of Muslims who join counter-terrorism off their religious identity alone.\\n\\nBut know I would rather trash my PhD than partake in the war on terror.\\n\\nNous Sommes Quebecois!\\n\\nIn 2017, a shooter entered a Quebec City mosque and shot the rows of 53 people as they prayed the night prayer, killing six people and injuring a further 19.\\n\\nOver 2,000 people filled the halls of the Montreal Olympic Stadium where the funeral prayer was held. I was asked to give a short speech alongside others. I initially wrote one for the Muslims in the audience. In the speech, I bore witness to the anger many felt towards the Quebecois political establishment which long legitimised the killer’s prejudices. Some of the politicians were there that day.\\n\\nBut I never gave that speech. I held back out of cowardice. Instead, I made the usual declaration of \"overcoming adversity together\" and in turn, as if mocked by my own spinelessness, the stadium shook with a chant: We are Quebecois! Nous sommes Quebecois!\\n\\nWhat was it, in that terrible moment, which led us all to draw the gaze towards ourselves, to our nationalities, no less? To me, it is the sight of the dead which provoked an insupportable reaction: to look at them, to truly bear witness to the circumstances of their death, had inspired anger towards Power which had legitimised the killer\\'s thoughts of Muslims. But this anger makes us seen in a bad light. Instead we implore Power\\'s gaze towards us, demanding its good light even more.\\n\\n\\'We are Quebecois! Can\\'t you see us?\\'\\n\\nHere the powerful and unsure \"do not get angry!\" shouted by Ralph Ellison\\'s protagonist to onlookers of an elderly Black couple\\'s eviction in Invisible Man resonated strongly with me. One is not allowed anger, of course, because the experience of anger, even if righteous, cannot exist outside Power\\'s gaze. The refusal to condemn, then, is a refusal of existing wholly in the gaze of Power.\\n\\nFor a brief moment, the Quebec mosque attack made us aware of Power\\'s gaze. But then we quickly forget the gaze and return to life within it as it defines the parameters of our experience. \"Do not get angry!\"\\n\\nI wrongly believed our salvation is in our being seen, when our task is to see. When we feed someone in need, we should shun the cameras and the proclamation that \"This is the true Islam!\" - but feed more, nonetheless. As awful as that silence may be, as strenuous as our rejection of cameras will require, we must learn to find peace in rejecting Power\\'s recognition.\\n\\nOne may claim to act in the unseen, or be seen only by God or for the sight of a particular group (\"the oppressed\"). But insofar as the gaze of Power encompasses all our actions, so too must its refusal be active.\\n\\nPut differently, for every public act committed by Muslims in the sight of others, there must be an equal impulse to resist this act from being subsumed by capitalist or nationalist ideologies, which engulf all within the good Muslim/bad Muslim binary.\\n\\nWe must realise it is the performance of seeing, rather than the status of being seen, which binds us together. But for anyone reading this who, like me, is a coward, it will not be easy. For the greatest idol will always be the self\\'s yearning to be seen.\\n\\nRefuse to condemn, resist to be seen\\n\\nMy mother taught me we are far from the rational creatures we think we are, and that a loaf of bread will bring two people closer than all the world\\'s philosophies combined. She taught that community is not an intellectual construct, but a performative one.\\n\\nThe refusal to condemn is not simply to refuse the \"good Muslim\" label - it is a resistance of our yearning to be seen by Power. To refuse to condemn, then, is to face the fear of mobilising on our own terms. There is no bravery without cowardice, no strength without vulnerability, no wisdom without ignorance. Insofar as the two drives of the world stand at their strongest - that is, capitalism and nationalism - our intentions will always waver between our desire to please God and Power.\\n\\nIllustration by Mohamad Elaasar',\n",
              " 'The outgoing president\\'s erratic behaviour and penchant for dictators leave the region in a worse state than when he first came to power\\n\\n\\n\\nOn Sunday 21 May 2017, four months after he was inaugurated as US president, Donald Trump entered a darkened room at the Global Centre for Combating Extremist Ideology, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. There, Trump, with his wife Melania looking on, stood alongside his host King Salman and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, placed his hands on a glowing orb mounted atop a pedestal, then looked out at the assembled media.\\n\\nThe photo of this moment, tweeted by the Saudi embassy in the United States, captured the global imagination. Here was the new leader of what was still the world\\'s most powerful country, in a chamber full of computers, surrounded by darkness and accompanied by two strongmen of the Middle East, appearing to draw some kind of ungodly power from a mysterious spheroid.\\n\\nUS President Donald Trump with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Saudi King Salman in Riyadh in 2017 (AFP)\\n\\nOpening this centre for \"combating extremist ideology,\" the new president heralded a \"clear declaration that Muslim-majority countries must take the lead in combating radicalisation, and I want to express our gratitude to King Salman for this strong demonstration of leadership\".\\n\\nThere were two Trump fixations lurking behind this statement: a belief that, as he put it in March 2016, \"Islam hates us\"; and a conviction that it was high time that America\\'s allies did the work they had previously outsourced to the US.\\n\\nDomestically, the Islamophobic nature of his administration had been confirmed in Trump\\'s first week of office, with the signing of Executive Order 13769, commonly known as the \"Muslim ban,\" which suspended entry to the US from a slew of Muslim-majority countries. Before becoming president, Trump said in November 2015 that he would \"certainly implement\" a database to track Muslims in the US, and had expressed agreement with a supporter at a 2015 rally in New Hampshire who told him, \"We have a problem in this country; it\\'s called Muslims.\"\\n\\nThe glowing orb was a prop. But this was Trump\\'s first foreign trip: everything was laden with symbolism\\n\\nIn Riyadh, it turned out the glowing orb was just a translucent globe – nothing more than a prop. But this was Trump\\'s first foreign trip - and everything was laden with symbolism.\\n\\nBeginning in Saudi Arabia, he later went on to Israel, where he descended from the plane to a red carpet and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who clasped him by the arm and repeated the line: \"Welcome my good friend.\" Trump later visited the Western Wall, becoming the first sitting US president to do so. He told a press conference that it was time Iran stopped their \"deadly funding\" of \"terrorists and militias\".\\n\\nThese moments turned out to be significant. They are worth consideration now that Trump will be replaced as president by Joe Biden, his Democrat opponent.\\n\\nTrump and the ties that bind\\n\\nAt the time of writing, this transition looks unlikely to be smooth. Congress is set to be controlled by the Democrats, while the Senate will likely be held by the Republicans. The next US administration may not find itself with much room for manoeuvre. Trump - and Trumpism - have not been given the shellacking many liberals hoped for. Both the man and the ideology are here to stay, with the deep divisions the US faces domestically impacting on its flailing performance abroad.\\n\\nThe foreign policy positions taken by the White House during the last four years may not easily be undone. It is also worth noting that Biden, the embodiment of a Democratic establishment that saw the systemic change offered by Bernie Sanders as just as dangerous as Trump, may have no real desire to undo them.\\n\\nThose positions have been most steadfast when it comes to Saudi Arabia and Israel. During Trump\\'s time in office, these two allies - already lavishly assisted by Washington - have received more diplomatic and political support from the US than any other states. This backing has existed alongside the personal championing of Netanyahu and Mohammed bin Salman, the self-proclaimed modernising crown prince of Saudi Arabia, who has been directly linked to a number of human rights abuses, including the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\\n\\nTrump has allied himself with strongmen such as Turkey\\'s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, pictured here at the London Nato summit in December 2019 (AFP)\\n\\nThat championing is reciprocated, and if there is anything that has defined a seemingly erratic American foreign policy under this president, then it is Trump\\'s mercantile fondness for strongmen he can do business with; leaders and nations whose ravenous self-interest makes cutting a deal possible.\\n\\nMore significantly, the president has been akin to a puppet or useful idiot for a series of foreign policy advisers, whose views were previously deemed extreme even by Washington\\'s standards, a leader often led by whoever is talking loudly in his ear. Trump would tire of these advisers after a while (or they would tire of him). Then they would leave the White House to write a book about what an idiot their boss was, usually laundering their reputation in the process.\\n\\nHostility towards Iran, aggressive championing of Israel, a selective interest in democracy, and a fondness for absolute rulers you could do business with have always been features of US foreign policy. But as with so many things during the Trump presidency, those features were distorted into their most severe form, with the usual victims – Palestinians, leftists, democracy advocates, Muslims – in a far worse position at the end of his term than they were four years ago.\\n\\nTrump\\'s road to the White House\\n\\nFor decades before he became president, Trump was a famous man who liked the sound of his own voice. This was compounded by the nature of his celebrity, which meant he was often asked about whether he was going to run for president, as well as his views on this or that policy.\\n\\nIt is probably fair to say that before he became US president in 2017, this son of a New York real estate millionaire, who spent as much time in front of the camera as he could, had never given much thought to the question of peace in the Middle East.\\n\\nBefore becoming president, Trump, pictured here at a casino opening in April 1990, was not known for his knowledge of Middle Eastern affairs (AFP)\\n\\nBut it\\'s also true that here was a man with a set of very distinct feelings and prejudices, who viewed life as a struggle for dominance and who valued the art of the deal above all else.\\n\\nWhen it came to the world at large, a common theme Trump returned to during his decades as a real estate celebrity and reality TV star was that countries which enjoyed some form of US military protection were not paying their way, that they were leeches and that American political leaders were being taken for suckers.\\n\\nIt\\'s a theme that continued into his campaign to become president and which has been present particularly in his stance towards Nato, whose fellow members he believes are subsidised by the US.\\n\\nIn September 1987, Trump took out full-page adverts - branded \"an open letter from Donald J Trump\" - in several major American newspapers. \"Make Japan, Saudi Arabia, and others pay for the protection we extend as allies,\" said the advert, which cost Trump $94,801. In TV interviews, he added Kuwait to the list. Trump urged the US to \"tax these wealthy nations,\" relieving itself of the \"cost of defending those who can easily afford to pay us for the defence of their freedom\".\\n\\nTrump is known to be over-sensitive. The open letter concluded: \"Let\\'s not let our great country be laughed at anymore.\"\\n\\nSaudi Arabia: Money matters\\n\\nBy the time Donald J Trump hit the presidential campaign trail in 2015, his stance on Saudi Arabia appeared to have changed. While countries like Germany and other members of the North Atlantic alliance were still deemed freeloaders, the Gulf kingdom was a well from which to drink deeply. \"Saudi Arabia - and I get along great with all of them,\" he said at one of his rallies in 2015. \"They buy apartments from me. They spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I supposed to dislike them? I like them very much.\"\\n\\nDonald Trump visited Saudi Arabia in 2017 on his first foreign trip as US president (Reuters)\\n\\nIn essence, this approach to Saudi Arabia changed little once Trump became president. On that first foreign trip as US leader, he and his family delighted at being ferried around in gold golf carts, and attending a $75m party thrown in his honour, complete with a throne for him to sit on. For a man whose main residence in Manhattan is a palace of brass and chintz, situated in a tower bearing his own name, Trump was at home in the Gulf.\\n\\nWith his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner hitting it off with Mohammed bin Salman, who was made crown prince in June 2017 and became the kingdom\\'s de facto leader, Trump doubled down on an alliance that had been slowly weakening since the turn of the 21st century.\\n\\nBarack Obama, Trump\\'s predecessor, had told the Saudis to stop amplifying \"external threats\" and signed the nuclear deal with Iran. Trump pulled out of the deal in May 2018.\\n\\nInfluenced by a string of virulently anti-Iranian advisers from Michael Flynn to Jim Mattis (who reportedly referred to the \"idiot raghead mullahs\" ruling the Islamic Republic) to Mike Pompeo to John Bolton, who had made regime change in Iran his life\\'s work, Trump amplified the threat from Tehran, imposing crippling sanctions, sending troops to the Persian Gulf and, in January 2020, ordering the killing of top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani.\\n\\nThe assassination of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018, which the CIA eventually linked back to bin Salman, provoked bi-partisan outrage in Washington. Trump was called on to take action against the errant crown prince: none was taken. \"I saved his ass,\" the president said of MBS in January 2020, according to Bob Woodward. \"I was able to get Congress to leave him alone. I was able to get them to stop.\"\\n\\nWhile Trump, and particularly Kushner, clearly liked MBS personally, the real reason for their support was money, and the president\\'s mercantile view of the world. The Saudi crown prince promised investment and he promised more money for American weapons.\\n\\nTrump holds a chart of weapon sales as he welcomes Mohammed bin Salman in the Oval Office in March 2018 (Reuters)\\n\\nIn March 2018, five months before Khashoggi\\'s murder, bin Salman sat next to Trump in the Oval Office while the president held up a chart that read, \"12.5 billion in finalised sales to Saudi Arabia,\" illustrated by pictures of US arms bought by the kingdom.\\n\\nAt a press conference in Japan in June 2019, eight months after the assassination of the Saudi journalist, Trump referred to bin Salman as \"a great friend of mine,\" a man who had \"done things in the last five years in terms of opening up Saudi Arabia... especially for women\". What was happening in the Gulf kingdom was, Trump said, \"like a revolution in a very positive way\". Asked more than once about Khashoggi, Trump dodged the question.\\n\\nA couple of months earlier, in April 2019, Trump had vetoed a bipartisan resolution to end American military involvement in Saudi Arabia\\'s war in Yemen.\\n\\nIsrael: Moving ever further to the right\\n\\nThe president\\'s support for Israel\\'s right-wing, led by Netanyahu, has, if anything, been more extreme than that for Saudi Arabia. On the campaign trail in March 2016, Trump told CNN that he was \"very pro-Israel,\" boasting about the donations he had made to the country and the awards he had received there.\\n\\nHis business interests in Israel prior to becoming president seemed to amount to not much more than a planned Trump Tower and a brand of vodka that was somewhat popular with the ultra-Orthodox community at Passover but deemed undrinkable by almost everyone else.\\n\\nDonald Trump visits the Western Wall in Jerusalem in May 2017 (AFP)\\n\\nAs for the Palestinians, Trump said that he would \"love to be neutral,\" but that it was hard because they were inflicting too much terror. \"They have to stop with the terror because what they\\'re doing with the missiles and with the stabbings and with all of the other things they do, it\\'s horrible and it\\'s got to end,\" he said in March 2016, repeating a view that is hardly uncommon among many Americans, namely that Palestinians are defined by their \"terrorism\".\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that, at this early stage, there were plenty of American commentators who deemed even this kind of rhetoric not sufficiently pro-Israel, with one CNN pundit noting Trump\\'s \"unusually objective language on Israel\" and pointing out that at that time, the Republican candidate had \"initially dodged a question on the possibility of moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem\".\\n\\nAs for the Palestinians, Trump said that he would \\'love to be neutral,\\' but that it was hard because they were inflicting too much terror\\n\\nThe wind was only blowing in one direction though. Sheldon Adelson, a strident Zionist whose longstanding dream was to see the embassy move to Jerusalem, eventually put tens of millions of dollars into Trump\\'s 2016 campaign (he put even more into the 2020 one). It was clear that the Republican nominee would most likely take a strongly pro-Israeli position should he become president.\\n\\nAlways a man comforted by the presence of familiar faces, Trump\\'s Middle East policy was defined by his son-in-law Jared Kushner and by two former Trump Organisation employees: the bankruptcy lawyer David Friedman and the real estate lawyer Jason Greenblatt.\\n\\nFriedman, who became the US ambassador to Israel, was a supporter and donor to illegal settlements on occupied Palestinian land. The son of a conservative rabbi, he had helped raise about $2m in tax-deductible donations each year from supporters of the settlement movement - including the Kushner family - through an organisation called American Friends of Beit El Institutions.\\n\\nGreenblatt, who had worked for Trump since 1997, was catapulted into the role of special representative for international negotiations, becoming one of the chief architects of Trump\\'s Middle East peace plan - the so-called \"deal of the century,\" which was rejected unanimously by the Palestinians. An advocate for illegal West Bank settlements, in November 2016 Greenblatt declared that they were \"not an obstacle to peace,\" and that he preferred them to be referred to as \"neighbourhoods\".\\n\\nWith Kushner also a family friend of Netanyahu\\'s, the odds were stacked heavily against the Palestinians: a 2017 Trump administration document stated that \"Israel is not the cause of the region\\'s problems\" and that \"jihadist terrorist organisations\" were the only thing standing in the way of peace.\\n\\nIn October 2019, Trump broadened his regular attacks on Somalia-born Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, an \"America-hating socialist,\" into a general broadside at the Somali community in Minnesota, telling a rally that he would \"give local communities a greater say in refugee policy and put in place enhanced vetting and responsible immigration controls\". In March 2019, a gunman who cited Trump as \"a symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose\" killed 51 people at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.\\n\\nTrump holds up a proclamation on the Golan Heights alongside Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington in March 2019 (AFP)\\n\\nThe 2017 national security document was followed by a slew of moves in support of Netanyahu and Israel\\'s nationalist right-wing. In February of that year, the US dropped its longstanding commitment to a two-state solution after Trump met with Netanyahu. In December 2017, Washington announced that it would move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.\\n\\nWhen the move came in May 2018, Adelson, who had offered to fund it, wept tears of joy: on that same day, more than 60 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces in a single day (some later died from their injuries) as they protested their right to return to ancestral homes.\\n\\nThis was four months after the Trump White House announced that it was cutting half its planned funding to UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. Before the year was out, the rest of the funding had been cut as well, as the US declared the agency an \"irredeemably flawed operation\".\\n\\nThe Middle East at its worst\\n\\nWhen it was released in January 2020, Trump\\'s Middle East peace plan was even worse than his many detractors had feared.\\n\\nIt accepted Israeli calls to annex the Jordan Valley and Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. It called for Jerusalem to become Israel\\'s undivided capital. It said that a Palestinian state could only happen when the Palestinian leadership wholly accepted Israel\\'s new borders, disarmed completely, removed Hamas from power in Gaza and agreed to Israeli security oversight across all of its territories until a point in the future deemed ripe for withdrawal. There was much more, none of it good for the Palestinians, who unanimously rejected the deal.\\n\\nREVEALED: Trump\\'s \\'deal of the century\\' map for a future Palestine, Israel Read More »\\n\\nThis plan for peace was then followed by normalisation agreements between Israel and the UAE, then between Israel and Bahrain. Sudan, crippled by US sanctions for years, has had its revolution rewarded by having a gun stuck to its head: sign a normalisation deal with Israel or else stay on the US terrorist list. It chose the former, to much crowing from Trump and Kushner.\\n\\nOther Arab nations may well follow: Kushner was quick to celebrate how he and his father-in-law broke down the decades-long solidarity between those nations when it came to Palestine.\\n\\nOnce, there was no peace with Israel without some justice for Palestine. That accord has been bludgeoned to the ground by a new regional order headed by Netanyahu and the Gulf kingdoms of Saudi Arabia and the UAE, from where Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed wields considerable influence over both Trump and Mohammed bin Salman.\\n\\nIn Egypt, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, another strongman, has been dubbed a \"killer\" by Trump.\\n\\nThis is a word used by the president both literally and as a mark of business acumen: tough dealmakers are, in the president\\'s language, \"killers\". Sisi fits the bill for both and has also been referred to by Trump as his \"favourite dictator\".\\n\\nMore recently, the US president suggested that Egypt could \"blow up\" the Ethiopian-built Nile Renaissance Dam that is causing enormous tensions between the two large African US allies. While Obama ended up tacitly removing support for Egypt\\'s Hosni Mubarak, Trump has actively championed Sisi, whose appalling record on human rights has gone virtually unacknowledged.\\n\\nA boy in Sanaa walks past a mural depicting a US drone and a message that reads: \\'Why did you kill my family\\' (AFP)\\n\\nElsewhere in the Middle East and North Africa, it was interesting for those of us who covered the real estate mogul\\'s campaign first for the Republican nomination, then for president, to take note of what he did once he was in office.\\n\\nBack in 2016, the foreign policy community was fixated with Trump\\'s perceived isolationism. At rally after rally, he claimed to have opposed the Iraq war - in fact, he only did so explicitly a year after the invasion – and talked of bringing US troops home.\\n\\nWhile it has to be acknowledged that Trump has certainly gone some way to making good on these promises by withdrawing thousands of troops from Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, thousands more remain out in the field.\\n\\nCivilian deaths have skyrocketed. The US drone strikes which escalated under Obama further escalated under Trump. In March 2019, the Republican president revoked a policy, introduced by his predecessor, requiring that intelligence officials publish the number of civilians killed in drone strikes outside of war zones.\\n\\nDuring the past four years, Washington has ceded geopolitical control in parts of Syria to Russia. Iran\\'s influence in Iraq has grown at its expense. But Trump\\'s position has been far from isolationist, however erratic it has been.\\n\\nUS troops remain in northeastern Syria, where there is a longstanding military engagement with the Islamic State (IS) group, whose leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was killed by the US in October 2019, a big win for Trump. Washington is unlikely to give up its base at al-Tanf in the Homs governorate any time soon, however useless it may be.\\n\\nUS sanctions against Syria appear to be hurting its population much more than its ruler, Bashar al-Assad, and his cronies. The removal of US military support from its Kurdish allies, long anticipated in the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, also known as Rojava, has nevertheless been a huge betrayal, even if American involvement was always seen by most citizens there as self-interested and likely to expire.\\n\\nTrump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago, Florida, in April 2017, from where Trump ordered a strike against Syria (AP)\\n\\nIn April 2017, Trump responded to a chemical weapons attack by the Syrian government with an air strike, which he ordered just after he sat down to dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping at his mansion in Mar-a-Lago, Florida. The US president reportedly ordered the attack after his daughter Ivanka showed him pictures of Syrian children affected by the chemical raid, a scene Steve Bannon described as \"disgusting\".\\n\\nTrump was responding emotionally, perhaps, but it was also a show of strength before a meeting with Xi: China has since taken the place of the Soviet Union in a new Cold War cooked up by the White House.\\n\\nDonald Trump\\'s time as president ends with many of America\\'s worst tendencies as global hegemon severely exacerbated and a few of its better ones more or less abandoned. Trump went at the question of Israel and Palestine with the scattershot enthusiasm of the showy dealmaker he is, eventually resulting in the darkest of Palestinian nightmares.\\n\\nUninterested in working but interested in being flattered and pampered, scornful of sincerely held beliefs but in thrall to power and money, Trump showed the world what America is at its worst: a place of desperate injustice, ruled by a wealthy few.\\n\\nIn bringing the US close to war with Iran, humiliating the Palestinians, having no coherent plan in Syria or Iraq and in championing murderous autocrats in the Gulf and North Africa, this US president and his administration has left the region in dreadful straits.\\n\\nOscar Rickett is a journalist who has written and worked for Middle East Eye, VICE, The Guardian, BBC, Channel 4, openDemocracy, Africa Confidential and various others.\\n\\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.\\n\\nPhoto: President Donald Trump listens during a ceremony to mark the opening of the Global Center for Combatting Extremist Ideology, Sunday, May 21, 2017, in Riyadh (AP)\\n\\nThis article is available in French on Middle East Eye French edition.',\n",
              " \"Investigation into Israel's deadly crackdown during the Second Intifada ultimately led to the deepest rupture in the history of the Palestinian people\\n\\nWe know of no other historical moment since the Nakba that united Palestinians in the way that the start of the Second Intifada did. We witnessed events that caught the attention of all Palestinians, as varying forms of struggle intensified across different areas.\\n\\nSmoke in the sky from burning tyres blurred the Green Line. Systematic Israeli fragmentation was disrupted for weeks on end\\n\\nUntil the outbreak of the intifada, we had also not witnessed since the Nakba a similar disintegration in the differences between Palestinians of 1948 and 1967. The Palestinian of Gaza died in 1948-occupied Palestine, and 1948 Palestinians were wounded in the neighbourhoods of Jerusalem. It was no longer possible to differentiate between photos of the occupied West Bank and the Triangle area of 1948 Palestine.\\n\\nSmoke in the sky from burning tyres blurred the Green Line. Systematic Israeli fragmentation was disrupted for weeks on end.\\n\\nTwenty years since the start of the Second Intifada, the question remains: How did this inclusive and collective event end with the deepest rupture in the history of the Palestinian people, and an unprecedented initiative by political and social groups within the 1948 Palestinian community to assimilate with colonial institutions?\\n\\nColonialist strategies\\n\\nThe answer requires assessing the reality in which we’ve lived for the past two decades, with knowledge of traditional colonialist strategies. Inside the Palestinian territories occupied in 1948, we witnessed a shift from unified uprisings to demands to integrate into Israeli institutions. How did Israel pave the path for our capitulation after the Second Intifada?\\n\\nThe essence of colonialist Zionist efforts is to rip apart the Palestinian people, both socially and politically. To achieve this, different legal and administrative models were followed in each geographical area, and the systems of control varied.\\n\\nIntifada: The writing was on the wall Read More »\\n\\nSeveral factors, including the extent of Israeli state violence, the level of “privileges” granted to each region or social stratum and the differing boundaries for political activism and work contributed to varying forms of Palestinian resistance in each area, along with different levels of individual and collective sacrifice.\\n\\nIn the first few days of the Second Intifada, unified resistance shook the Israeli system of division, upsetting its security and political balance. The uprising fuelled a barrage of clash points that shocked and drained the security system. It brought the enemy back to its primitive savagery, uncovering its bloody essence.\\n\\nBullets alone were not enough to stem the uprising. Israel needed a deeper and longer process to consolidate its system of division. This process consisted of reframing the narrative and erasing the unified character that differentiated uprising from crime.\\n\\nCrushing the uprising\\n\\nThe state carried out this operation by way of a device with a vital historical role, cloaked in the appearance of an investigative committee: the Orr Commission. Formally titled the National Commission of Inquiry into the Clashes Between the Security Forces and Israeli Citizens in October 2000, the committee was appointed by the Israeli government and headed by Supreme Court Justice Theodore Orr to investigate and report on the killing of 13 Palestinians by Israeli police.\\n\\nOn 28 September 2000, worshippers and leaders from Palestinians in the '48 territories stood to confront then-Likud leader Ariel Sharon when he marched into the al-Aqsa Mosque compound. The next day brought hundreds to the mosque again; several Palestinians were killed and scores more were injured. Israeli bullets did not differentiate between Palestinians’ different-coloured IDs.\\n\\nOn 30 September, as political factions announced a general strike, the Galilee and Triangle regions witnessed protests and civil disobedience in the form of road closures, and an attack on a police station in Nazareth. It was clear that evening, especially after images emerged of 12-year-old Mohammed al-Durrah’s killing, that the fires in each Palestinian village and city would not easily be put out.\\n\\nPalestinian police duck as Israeli troops open fire near Gaza City in October 2000 (AFP)\\n\\nWithin the span of a month, Israeli forces crushed the intifada in the 1948 territories. Scores of people were killed, wounded or imprisoned. Economic pressure was used, including the suppression of vital services and products. We also saw waves of workers fired.\\n\\nIn November, the Orr Commission was appointed - a defining moment in the “Arab-Israeli” narrative of the intifada in 1948 areas. The final report was based on an extensive hearing process and published in September 2003. Its main finding was that the root cause of the uprising in '48 was “discrimination”, and it criticised the government for not prioritising the needs of this community. It called on the state to close gaps in education, housing, development, employment and services.\\n\\nRacial discrimination\\n\\nAmid the extraction of these important issues from their colonial context, the report ignored the al-Aqsa Mosque issue - the catalyst that brought people to the streets. From its publication up until today, the report constitutes the main outline of the Israeli government’s policies towards Palestinians of 1948.\\n\\nThe government adopted the committee’s recommendations, formed a special committee to implement them and drew up parliamentary groups to monitor their implementation. Many plans were created to “develop the Arab sector” and integrate Palestinians into government institutions.\\n\\nThe 1948 Palestinian leadership's adoption of the report was a huge mistake - no less of a blunder than the Oslo Accords for the 1967 Palestinian territories\\n\\nMore importantly, the report was used as evidence of racial discrimination against Palestinians in ’48, becoming a central reference for political and human rights work in the community. Palestinian parties in the Knesset drew up speeches and draft laws based on it, as well as dozens of petitions to human rights groups.\\n\\nThe 1948 Palestinian leadership’s adoption of the report was a huge mistake - no less of a blunder than the Oslo Accords for the 1967 Palestinian territories.\\n\\nThe report is based on an axiom that cannot be altered in the eyes of Israelis: that Palestinians of 1948 are not an organic part of the Palestinian people, and that Palestinians cannot have unified political ambitions as a people. The report does not define Palestinians in ‘48 as Palestinians. Our Palestinian heritage, in the sense of political engagement and the natural quest for unification of political aspirations, is completely absent.\\n\\nA deeper crisis\\n\\nThe Orr Commission aimed to “cure” Palestinian unity by restoring the model of colonial separation, which had been cracked. It implemented the colonial framework of transforming the colonised into subjects without any will. The issues and opinions that brought thousands into the streets, and the sacrifices they made, became mere symptoms of a deeper crisis in their relationship with authorities. It was as though tens of thousands hadn’t gone out in protest, waving Palestinian flags and professing their Palestinian identity.\\n\\nA new intifada for a new generation Read More »\\n\\nAn official summation of the report reads: “The riots inside the state coincided with serious riots in Judea, Samaria and the Gaza Strip. Prominent personages from the Arab sector indicated this was not coincidental, and reflected interaction between Palestinians inside the Green Line and Palestinians on the other side of the demarcation.”\\n\\nIt continues: “Even this combination of events is unprecedented. Against the background of these aspects, the events were considered an ‘intifada’ that exceeded the definition of local uprisings … The messages transmitted during the October disturbances blurred and sometimes erased the distinction between the state’s Arab citizens and their legitimate struggle for rights, and the armed struggle against the state being conducted by organisations and individuals in the West Bank and Gaza.”\\n\\nNoting that “the concept of citizenship is incompatible with the presentation of the state as the enemy”, the report details methods to disperse protests in the ’48 territories, the circumstances in which it might be necessary to use live ammunition and rules on the use of snipers.\\n\\nEconomic development\\n\\nThese are not questions that Israelis ask about the crimes they commit in the occupied West Bank. Presenting it in this context is not a judicial formality, nor merely a democratic attempt to preserve the image of Israel. It is a means of control, ensuring that soft power is managed as a tool for division.\\n\\nThe report summation notes: “The state must work to wipe out the stain of discrimination against its Arab citizens, in its various forms and expressions. In this context, the state must initiate, develop and operate programmes emphasising budgets that will close gaps in education, housing, industrial development, employment and services.”\\n\\nAn Israeli bulldozer demolishes a Palestinian shop in the occupied West Bank in July 2004 (AFP)\\n\\nAfter the state formally adopted the report’s recommendations and the illusions of accountability for those responsible for the killing of 13 martyrs were dispelled, nothing remained of the commission’s report beyond its calls for “bridging economic and social gaps”. In practice, the report paved the way for a tango dance between the Israeli government and the political leadership of 1948 Palestinians.\\n\\nThis ultimately led in 2015 to Government Resolution 922, a five-year plan that the Joint List celebrated as a great achievement. It explicitly vowed, for example, to recruit hundreds of Arab officers into Israel’s police service, alongside other more profound blunders, under the guise of “economic development”.\\n\\nAlso as part of the Orr report’s implementation, the Authority for the Economic Development of the Arab, Druze and Circassian Sector was established in 2007 as part of the Prime Minister’s Office, with the explicit aim of developing Arab initiatives and investments in Israel, encouraging integration into the Israeli labour market.\\n\\nFalsifying history\\n\\nThis was all done with the aim of strengthening 1948 Palestinians’ attachment to Israel, and to fuel the sociopolitical divisions of the Palestinian people. Experience has taught us not to raise our expectations of the political leadership, whose status and functions are rooted in colonial law.\\n\\nThe report is an ugly and shameful falsification of a glorious historical moment, and of the will of those who took to the streets that day\\n\\nIn 1976, when Land Day events broke out, the Israeli government was presented with the confidential Koenig Report, which was later leaked to an Israeli newspaper. It aimed to outline the repression of Palestinians in ’48, maintaining their political subservience to Israel and deterring them from “nationalist tendencies”. The document argues that the reason for the “rebellion” of Land Day was that the state did not equip the tools to secure their attachment to the Jewish community in a proper and effective manner.\\n\\nThe similarity between the logic of the Koening Report and the Orr Commission report is striking. The Orr report appears as an implementation of the Koening document, which called to manage the suppression of Palestinians in ‘48 with the ability to analyse the disturbing trends and try to treat them with objective thought that secures long-term Jewish national interests.\\n\\nPalestinians played into the divisive and colonial logic of the Orr Commission by demanding its establishment, participating in its work and adopting its recommendations. The report is an ugly and shameful falsification of a glorious historical moment, and of the will of those who took to the streets that day.\\n\\nThe investigation did not lead to any justice. All it did was highlight to Palestinians in ‘48 their advantage over the occupied West Bank and Gaza: that their blood deserves a commission of inquiry.\\n\\nA longer version of this article first appeared in Metras website.\\n\\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.\",\n",
              " 'Wagner Group\\'s fighters have seized a key role in Libya\\'s conflict. Middle East Eye meets the Libyans who suffered at their hands\\n\\nEsbia, Libya - When the Wagner mercenary placed his hand on Mohammed Abu Ajila Enbis’ shoulder, pushing him into the gravel and cocking his gun, the 28-year-old was scared - but most of all he was surprised.\\n\\n“They’d treated us well,” he tells Middle East Eye, standing in the bullet hole-ridden outhouse where he lost his father, brother and brother-in-law. “They’d given us food and drink, and we assumed they would eventually just let us go.”\\n\\nEnbis stumbled across the foreign fighters, speaking what sounded like Russian and English, near his home in Esbia, a rural town 50km outside Tripoli.\\n\\nHe’d been forced from his home by heavy fighting on 23 September 2019, when the assault on Tripoli by eastern commander Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) was at its height.\\n\\nThe outhouse where the Enbis family were shot by foreign mercenaries (MEE/Daniel Hilton)\\n\\nNow, with a lull in clashes, Enbis had risked heading home to check on his property. But as he crept through the fields, using the long shadows cast by the late afternoon sun as cover, he stumbled across the mercenaries.\\n\\nThey likely belonged to the Wagner Group, a Kremlin-linked private army sent to Libya to prop up the LNA as it struggled to seize Tripoli from the UN-recognised Government of National Accord (GNA).\\n\\n“They turned around, saw me and fired warning shots in the air,” he recalls. “But then, when I started to flee, they followed me.”\\n\\nInadvertently, Enbis led the fighters to the house where he’d been sheltering in nearby al-Hurriyeh. There, they detained him, along with his father Abu Ajila, brothers Hussam and Mohammed, and brother-in-law Hamza.\\n\\n\\'Each Russian was big, heavily built, and one seemed to have a prosthetic leg\\' - Mohammed Abu Ajila Enbis\\n\\n“They took our IDs and phones, and they had lots of equipment and were speaking clearly in Russian,” Enbis says.\\n\\nDuring the next few hours they moved the family from place to place. “At one point they took us to a field command post, where they seemed to be discussing with their commanders what to do with us,” he says.\\n\\n“It was a hot night, and while they kept us in the back of a van they doused water over our heads. The water made our blindfolds transparent, and I could see their bright red faces and green eyes. Each Russian was big, heavily built, and one seemed to have a prosthetic leg.”\\n\\nEventually, Enbis and his family were taken to a farm. One by one they were walked, bound and blindfolded, into a concrete outhouse, then forced to kneel in a row.\\n\\n“I was the last to be lined up. Then they sprayed us with bullets. I threw myself down and pretended I was dead.”\\n\\nBut the fighters, apparently in a hurry, left without checking their captives were dead. Enbis lay silently in the dark next to his lifeless and bloody relatives until, after a few minutes, he heard: “Brothers, are you alive? What happened? What happened? Father, are you alive?”\\n\\nEnbis’ brother Hussam had survived, but had been shot several times in one leg. The rest of the family was dead.\\n\\nWagner Group: The Kremlin\\'s proxy army\\n\\nAs a private military company, an opaque amalgamation of shadowy firms and contractors, Wagner has no official links to the Kremlin. But its ties to Yevgeniy Prigozhin, a close associate of Vladimir Putin and former restauranteur, tell a different story.\\n\\nAs do the theatres it operates in: Wagner mercenaries have been reported as active in Syria, Ukraine, Belarus and the Central African Republic, all places of strategic interest for Moscow.\\n\\nKirill Semenov, a Libya expert at the Russian International Affairs Council think tank in Moscow, tells MEE: “Wagner independently concludes contracts for its activities. But before concluding a contract, it coordinates with the structures of the Russian government, though I think this is hardly the Kremlin. Most likely, the Wagner leadership is coordinating its actions with the defence ministry.”\\n\\nMoscow has largely hedged its bets in Libya, eager to secure both $4bn worth of construction and arms deals it signed under deposed dictator Muammar Gaddafi and a foothold in the Mediterranean. As a result, in recent years it has kept lines open with Haftar, the GNA and even Saif al-Islam, Gaddafi’s son.\\n\\nYet its support for Haftar has grown over time. A 2016 visit by Haftar to a Russian warship was followed by economic and logistical aid, and eventually a deployment of 300 Wagner fighters in March 2019, a month before the LNA\\'s assault on Tripoli was launched.\\n\\nKhalifa Haftar leaves Russia\\'s foreign ministry after a meeting in Moscow in 2016 (AFP)\\n\\nAs the LNA struggled to break through the capital’s outskirts late last year, Haftar sought more help. Already, he had the military backing of Egypt and the UAE, which supplied him with weapons, equipment and air power, as well the diplomatic cover of France. But he needed extra expertise - and for this he turned to Russia.\\n\\nSome reports have put the number of Wagner operatives in Libya in the thousands, although Semenov says that number is unlikely unless Syrians recruited from pro-Bashar al-Assad militias are taken into account.\\n\\nRussians dominate its ranks, but Wagner is also known to employ Serbians and Ukrainians. Meanwhile Enbis’ recollection of the mercenaries speaking English raises the question of other nationalities, too - something Semenov suggests could be attributed to Wagner’s involvement in Ukraine.\\n\\n“Representatives of many countries, including the EU, fought in Donbass, and could remain in touch with them,” he says.\\n\\nIn Libya, Wagner’s mercenaries provided training for LNA fighters, aided artillery teams, guarded high-ranking officers, operated Russian Pantsir air defence systems and repaired military equipment. The group’s fighters also operated as particularly effective snipers, sowing fear in GNA forces and civilians alike.\\n\\nBut essentially, Wagner\\'s fighters allowed the LNA\\'s battalions to take the lead on the more difficult and dangerous frontline.\\n\\n“In general, the contribution of the Wagner Group to the stability of the LNA front near Tripoli was quite large. But this is more about defence. Wagner had few resources to support the LNA offensive,” Semenov said.\\n\\nUndeniable: Russia\\'s involvement\\n\\nBy spring 2020, Moscow’s mood had changed. Wagner had initially given Haftar’s offensive new impetus, but it also prompted Turkey to back its ally the GNA with drones, weapons and Syrian mercenaries.\\n\\nSensing that a continued siege on Tripoli was futile, Putin spoke to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on 8 May, precipitating a Wagner withdrawal.\\n\\nThe images subsequently circulated online and in Libyan media were striking: convoys of armoured vehicles charging east, leaving the LNA to fight alone.\\n\\nHaftar’s forces have long denied the Russians’ presence, despite the odd photo or video clip of well-tooled foreigners on roads or in restaurants. Now this latest footage made those denials all the more toothless.\\n\\nWagner fighters seen at a shop, road and takeout restaurant (Social media)\\n\\nThe LNA quickly began losing ground. As fighters allied to the GNA quickly recaptured Tripoli’s suburbs, more evidence of the Russian involvement was uncovered, including elaborate mines and booby-traps left in homes, a tactic condemned by the US.\\n\\nThe United States’ Africa Command (AFRICOM) said in July it had clear evidence that Wagner planted landmines and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in and around Tripoli. “The Wagner Group’s irresponsible tactics are prolonging conflict and are responsible for the needless suffering and the deaths of innocent civilians,” said Major-General Bradford Gering, its director of operations. “Russia has the power to stop them, just not the will.”\\n\\nIn the suburb of Ain Zara, white nationalist graffiti was found scrawled in Russian on a mosque’s walls.\\n\\nRussian graffiti reading “I see mosques on Russian soil, but I’d rather see them in hellfire” on the wall of an Ain Zara mosque, along with the 14/88 neo-Nazi tag (Social media)\\n\\nOne line read: “I see mosques on Russian soil, but it would be better to see them in hellfire.” It was accompanied by the 14/88 neo-Nazi tag. Another read: “There is no black in the colours of Zenit,” a nod to the St Petersburg football team, whose ultra supporters are notoriously racist.\\n\\nSuch sentiments are common among Wagner’s ranks, Semenov says. “From what is known, there are indeed a lot of fascists, Nazis and racists in Wagner who identify with the ‘white Vikings’. Moreover, many of them are not Orthodox Christians, but pagans.”\\n\\n\\'A booby trap went off and killed him\\'\\n\\nRinged by oval outer walls and dotted with pine trees, Esbia’s hospital made the perfect, and serene, headquarters for Wagner. Surrounded by open land, its fighters had a clear view all around. The complex lay far from the GNA’s artillery range while having quick access to the frontline.\\n\\nThe facility also boasted a water tower, two electricity generators and multiple accommodation suites, thanks to Gaddafi’s propensity to build hospitals with rooms where foreign medical workers could live.\\n\\nAccommodation in Esbia hospital used by Wagner mercenaries as a headquarters (MEE/Daniel Hilton)\\n\\nBut when the order came to retreat, new temporary positions had to be secured, to the distress of Ahmad Ammar Ahmad, a mechanic in nearby Tarhuna.\\n\\nOn 21 May, Ahmad’s 20-year-old son Amr returned to their Tarhuna home to find the door open and three military vehicles parked in the adjacent workshop. Quickly, he summoned his father.\\n\\n“I saw Russians using communications equipment. When I tried to negotiate with them, a huge Syrian arrived called Burkan. He said: ‘We’re brothers, don’t worry. We only need this place for a few days and we’ll give it back to you in perfect condition’,” recalls Ahmad.\\n\\nNot wanting to attract the attention of the LNA’s feared Kaniyat militia who ran the town, Ahmad eventually relented, only returning two days later when Wagner’s antennae had been removed from his roof and the pictures of the mercenaries’ withdrawal flashed up on TV.\\n\\nThe place was a tip. Cigarette butts, shoes, bags and trash were everywhere.\\n\\n“We started cleaning to get the place ready for Eid. The bathroom was a mess, and we were worried about coronavirus. The water wasn’t running, and when my son started going up the stairs to the roof to check on the water tank, a booby trap went off and killed him.”\\n\\nAnother explosive was found further up the stairs. When Ahmad tried to register his son\\'s death, LNA authorities in Tarhuna bristled at his story.\\n\\n\"They told me \\'There are no Russians here, only a Libyan army\\' and made me say a Turkish air strike killed my son instead.\"\\n\\nHaftar\\'s permanent allies\\n\\nFor Russia, private military contractors such as Wagner are a way of getting boots on the ground without getting its hands dirty. The company\\'s murky structure gives Moscow a certain distance and deniability, particularly as atrocities are reported.\\n\\nOn 14 October, however, there was a significant development: Prigozhin was hit by EU sanctions due to his “close links, including financially” with Wagner and its breaches of an UN arms embargo on Libya, which “threaten the country\\'s peace, stability and security\".\\n\\nThis 14 July 2020 satellite image released by the US reportedly shows Wagner utility trucks and Russian mine-resistant, ambush-protected armoured vehicles in Sirte, Libya (AFP)\\n\\nHanan Salah, Human Rights Watch’s senior researcher for Libya, calls the sanctions positive, “but it really doesn’t go far enough\".\\n\\n\"I don’t think that the European Union should stop there. Are they going to sanction any Turkish groups? Are they going to sanction the United Arab Emirates or Egypt for their violations of the arms embargo?\" she tells MEE.\\n\\n“Don’t just stop at the arms embargo violations but look at the fallout of that, the violations that result in the violation of the arms embargo.”\\n\\nWhen MEE asked Major-General Ahmed al-Mismari, the LNA’s spokesman, about Wagner’s involvement in the Tripoli offensive, he said that he had “no idea” what MEE was talking about. “But I know that Russia has great forces and they have positions all over the world, even in Britain and also near the borders of USA. If they want to be somewhere no one can stop them.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, Tripoli’s relations with Russia are now frosty, to say the least.\\n\\nThe killing fields of Libya\\'s Tarhuna Read More »\\n\\nTwo Prigozhin-linked Russians were arrested in May 2019 while liaising with Saif al-Islam Gaddafi about a possible political comeback, and are now held in a detention centre at Mitiga airport on the outskirts of Tripoli.

They have also occupied Sharara, the country’s largest oil field.\\n\\nRussia remains a key player in international attempts at reconciliation talks between Libya’s eastern and western rivals, however, and reportedly supervised a dialogue in Egypt in September.\\n\\nBut that hasn’t dissuaded western Libyan officials from seeking further international action against Wagner, whose fighters now appear to have become a permanent fixture in Haftar’s ranks.\\n\\n“People should wake up and take notice of the Wagner’s crimes - here and worldwide,” Rabia Abu Ras, an MP based in Tripoli, tells MEE.\\n\\n“They are like Daesh, a terrorist group.

              " 'Emgage\\'s rise to prominence during the 2020 US election is not a story of a group that advocates for Muslim communities, but rather of one that has served to mute their voices\\n\\nWhat if he wins again?\\n\\nAs early voting gets underway in what has ceremoniously been dubbed the most important election in recent memory, liberal talk show hosts, mainstream newspaper columnists, and social media influencers are lamenting what a potential second term for Donald Trump would look like.\\n\\nSince entering office in 2017, the reality TV star and businessman has ushered in an era of intense political polarisation, repeatedly promising to turn Muslim Americans\\' darkest fears into reality.\\n\\nHe has failed to denounce far-right extremist and racist groups and sentiments when prompted, signed an executive order banning people from six Muslim-majority countries from entering the US, and suggested that, under his administration, Muslims may be listed and recorded in a national database.\\n\\nShould Trump win on 3 November, the next four years could be more disruptive to US foreign policy and world affairs than the last four.\\n\\nFor many Muslims then, the election offers only one stark choice: vote Joe Biden and stave off a Trump re-election.\\n\\nBut in recent months, a growing number of Muslims, who have a long-held distrust of the Democratic party, have expressed alarm that the election promises little more than a potential step back from Trump-inspired fascism.\\n\\n\\'I remain unsurprised at the cadre of Muslim Americans eager to step up in defence of US empire-building\\' - Nazia Kazi, Stockton University\\n\\nFor many, the election has opened a Pandora\\'s box of uncomfortable questions, including: \"Who gets to speak for, decide on, and represent the Muslim community\\'s issues in the corridors of power?\"\\n\\nAt the centre of that vexation is an organisation named Emgage.\\n\\nDespite relative obscurity just a few years ago, Emgage, which describes itself as \"the first and largest\" national Muslim American political action committee (PAC), has enjoyed sizeable media coverage in the months and weeks leading up to this presidential election.\\n\\nThe publicity stunts began earlier this year, but much of the attention focused on Emgage stems from an online summit held this summer in which Biden addressed the Muslim American community.\\n\\nAn appearance by a presidential candidate at a Muslim event would have been unthinkable, Democratic insiders say, during Barack Obama\\'s 2008 campaign, with the former president routinely fending off rumours that he was a Muslim for a large part of his candidacy and presidency.\\n\\nBut Trump\\'s frequent attacks on Islam and Muslims have created what the Biden campaign sees as an opportunity to snap up a chunk of the electorate in several swing states, including in Michigan, Ohio, Florida and North Carolina.\\n\\nThere are an estimated 3.45 million Muslims in the United States - a tiny portion of the population - but the Muslim vote in Florida for George W Bush, for instance, is sometimes credited with making Bush president in 2000.\\n\\nWhile Emgage has received attention from the Biden campaign, very little is publicly known about the organisation\\'s actual ties to and place in the Muslim community.\\n\\nBut Muslim American community organisers who have long known the group, its founders and board members - and its links to pro-Israel groups - say Emgage\\'s rise to national prominence is not the story of a group that advocates for the Muslim community, but rather one that is meant to muzzle it.\\n\\nThe story of Emgage\\n\\nFormed in 2006 by two Muslim lawyers from Florida, Khurrum Wahid and Farooq Mitha, the organisation was initially known as the Center for Voter Advocacy - before it changed its name to Emerge and later in 2016 to Emgage.\\n\\nAs an organisation, Emgage is made up of three legal entities. Emgage Foundation focuses on \"Get Out The Vote\" and registration of voters. Emgage Action is meant to advocate for issues important to Muslims, such as political literacy and civic engagement, as well as pushing back on policies that hurt the community. And Emgage PAC purportedly supports political candidates that align with the values of the community.\\n\\nIts governance is made up of a national board, with its six local chapters in Michigan, Virginia, New York, Pennsylvania, Florida and Texas, each governed by local boards.\\n\\nIn an interview with MEE in Washington, DC, in March, Wahid said the idea of the organisation really had its roots in the 2004 election between George W Bush and John Kerry. He said that even then, after the 9/11 2001 attacks and the Patriot Act, which created draconian counter-terrorism and surveillance powers that disproportionately affected Muslim communities, the stakes were seen as higher than ever before.\\n\\n\"We didn\\'t have a mechanism in the community to engage the grassroots and get them to have a voice, and be part of the decision-making process,\" he said.\\n\\n\\'If a million Muslims do vote, they will simply claim that they managed to get them all, which is simply not true\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n- Sarwat Hussain, community organiser, Texas\\n\\nWahid reasoned that Muslims, making up around one percent of the population, were perceived as a liability in the political world.\\n\\n\"I wanted to change that. It was about getting respect back for this community,\" Wahid said.\\n\\nOne of the first fundraising events the new group organised involved Keith Ellison, then a Congressional candidate from Minneapolis. That event in 2006 gave birth to the first iteration of Emgage as a PAC, an entity allowed to raise funds for political candidates. It also helped Ellison become the first Muslim in Congress.\\n\\nEllison, now the attorney-general of Minnesota, confirmed Wahid\\'s version of events to MEE.\\n\\nAround 2008, the group focused on consolidating the Muslim vote for Obama.\\n\\nFollowing the election of Obama, Mitha, who was previously a Fulbright Scholar in Amman, working on Jordanian-Israeli relations, and a partner at a law firm, joined the Obama administration as the special assistant to the director of the Department of Defense (DOD), in which he helped try to align small businesses with the urgent needs of the DOD.\\n\\nFrom 2014, Emgage began to branch out of Florida, creating chapters in swing states where Muslim voters could make the difference between two candidates as their own bloc. In 2016, the group started its Get Out The Vote efforts across multiple states and received grant money.\\n\\nCommunity activists from Florida and Texas who recall Emgage in the early days say the organisation spent much of its formative years networking with groups and organisations rather than organising at the grassroots level.\\n\\nSeveral activists characterise Emgage as either trying to moderate the kinds of work being undertaken in the community, or controlling the visibility of other organisations.\\n\\nSarwat Hussain, co-chair of the American Muslim Democratic Caucus-National (AMDC-National), says she has been familiar with Emgage since 2012, and that her first interaction with the group\\'s leadership involved her being told by an Emgage board member to downplay her \"Muslimness\".\\n\\n\"He told me \\'don\\'t be upfront about your \\'Muslimness\\'. But it was the opposite of what we were trying to do. We were trying to show that Muslims were here to stay, to serve. I refused,\" Hussain, who is based in San Antonio, Texas, said.\\n\\n\\n\\nHussain, along with several other community organisers across the country, told MEE that Emgage board members also found ways to pit Muslim activists and political organisers against each other, often using existing tropes to demonise others\\' work. Following the fallout, they would attempt to bring in their own contacts to take over the roles.\\n\\nEmgage held its Muslim Votes Summit in July 2020 (Emgage Action)\\n\\nShe said once she recognised how Emgage operated, she and other organisers tried to steer clear of the group.\\n\\n\"They were always seen as trying to come in where work was already being done, and then claim the work as theirs,\" said Nadia Ghabin, a community organiser in Florida, who was approached in 2018 by Emgage to partner on voter registrations. She flatly refused.\\n\\nOlivia Cantu, who worked for Emgage for four years before she was fired on 30 June 2020, confirmed that Emgage had a tendency to bulldoze its way over other organisations.\\n\\nShe said that though there were honest and hardworking individuals at Emgage trying to make sense of the political terrain, Emgage in Florida was run by \"a shadow board,\" in which decisions were often made between the real powerbrokers outside of formal meetings.\\n\\nCantu, who started off as a volunteer at Emgage and moved up the ranks to become Florida operations director, told MEE she was not presented with a reason for her dismissal.\\n\\nShe assumes she was dismissed because she had refused to stop working with the Indian American Muslim Council (IAMC) on the issue of rising Hindu nationalism, after a certain Emgage board member felt the organisation was not financially benefiting from the work.\\n\\nMEE has a copy of her submission to Emgage\\'s human resources department shortly after her termination. Emgage did not respond to MEE\\'s request for comment on why Cantu was dismissed.\\n\\nEmgage under Trump\\n\\nThough it is unclear what Emgage achieved before 2016 as an organisation, and there is a very thin digital footprint of the organisation\\'s achievements outside of its own website, there is a general consensus that, since the start of the Trump presidency, the organisation\\'s profile has ballooned.\\n\\nThe election of Trump in 2016 saw a wave of progressive candidates running for local or district, state and Congressional office around the country. Emgage jumped on this wave, too, announcing it would support young Muslim candidates running for office.\\n\\nThe organisation supported and endorsed several Muslim candidates, including Congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, as well as other candidates running for state legislatures, especially in swing states.\\n\\nAs part of a conglomerate of groups resisting Trump\\'s racism, Islamophobia, xenophobia and white supremacist leanings, Emgage was able to raise its voice as part of a chorus of liberal outrage against the administration.\\n\\nAs a Muslim organisation closely tied to the Democratic establishment, Emgage focused on promoting itself as a rearguard defence of Muslim Americans, outspoken on causes with which the liberal establishment was comfortable and carefully tiptoeing around more difficult matters the mainstream had yet to reach consensus over.\\n\\nDomestically, it spoke against the Muslim ban, on immigration and criminal justice reform. Following the murder of George Floyd, it condemned police brutality and anti-Black violence.\\n\\nWhere many progressives (and increasingly many young Muslim Americans) are in favour of Medicare For All and the Green New Deal, Emgage speaks vaguely about the \"issues\" of climate change and healthcare.\\n\\nOn matters of human rights abroad, it has stuck to positions that align with overall US foreign policy: the Rohingya in Myanmar, the Uighurs in China and, following the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the rise of authoritarianism in Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nSince August 2019, Emgage has also raised, albeit more carefully, the crisis in Kashmir and the rise of Hindu nationalism in India.\\n\\nBut Emgage has never properly demonstrated how it reaches consensus as an organisation on a political issue, be it domestic or foreign policy focused.\\n\\nEven as it styles itself to the Democratic establishment as a Muslim American powerhouse, it remains on the periphery of Muslim America\\'s imagination.\\n\\nAnd if it is barely known among South Asian and Arab Muslims, it is certainly not a part of the Black Muslim community. The national board is made up of predominantly South Asians and Arabs - and they are all men.\\n\\nWahid acknowledged that this was problem.\\n\\n\"We passed a resolution a couple of years ago, that decided that one third of the board had to be women by the 2020 election cycle\" he told MEE.\\n\\n\\n\\nMEE was not able to find any evidence of this resolution on their website.\\n\\n\"The founders are people with roots in South Asia, but they\\'re not exclusive and are open to reaching beyond that community,\" Ellison, the attorney-general of Minnesota, told MEE.\\n\\n\"I\\'m a Black Muslim and I\\'ve never felt that they\\'re exclusive or don\\'t want to partner. They\\'ve always been kind and open to me. My experience with them has been positive.\"\\n\\nStill, activists say hosting fundraisers for a Black politician does not mean being connected to the Black community.\\n\\nEmgage\\'s modus operandi on the ground, activists say, has been to rely on sweeping statements that promote it continuously as the \"largest\" and the go-to organisation for all things related to politics and the Muslim community, when it simply does not have the capacity or the legitimacy to undertake the projects it claims to lead.\\n\\n\"If you want to know if they are a grassroots organisation, no, they don\\'t exist as one,\" said Ghabin, from Florida.\\n\\nEmgage\\'s national board, before the page was taken down from their website, in September 2020 (Emgage)\\n\\nHussain, who describes herself as a committed member of the Democratic Party, told MEE that organisations such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the American Democratic Caucus, and others, had been conducting voter outreach for years and \"wonders what Emgage means when they position their work as \\'historic\\'\".\\n\\n\"Promising a million votes for the Democratic Party is not an easy thing,\" Hussain says, adding: \"If a million Muslims do vote, they will simply claim that they managed to get them all, which is simply not true.\"\\n\\nWael Alzayat, the CEO of Emgage Action, said allegations it didn\\'t exist as a grassroots organisation were \"not true\".\\n\\n\"Our Million Muslim Votes summit was attended by nearly 2,000 members and grassroots supporters. Emgage currently has 24,000 members who have opted to receive our correspondence and/or actively donate to the organisation,\" Alzayat told MEE.\\n\\nIn March 2020, Wahid told MEE that Emgage had 5,000 members. MEE cannot independently verify how many members the organisation has or if its membership did increase five-fold in the past six months, especially given there is no indication of membership numbers in its annual reports.\\n\\nBut grassroot organisers say exaggerations have often seen Emgage tangled in its own spin.\\n\\nIn Wahid\\'s letter to Muslim Americans last month, addressing his participation and that of three others from Emgage in MLI, the Muslim Leadership Initiative - a controversial scheme which, in part, brings Muslim Americans to Israel to study Judaism and Zionism - he tried to play down the impact four individuals might have had in an organisation made up of \"100 staffers and national and local board members\".\\n\\nWhen MEE asked the CEO how many staff members Emgage had, Alzayat, in his reply on 23 September said: \"23 employees, 20+ seasonal organisers, and over 400 volunteers\".\\n\\nEmgage has promoted itself as indispensable in getting Muslims out to vote. In doing so, it has released a series of stats and reports illustrating how Muslims came out to vote as a result of its efforts. The only problem is that Emgage cites only its own research as proof of impact, rather than any independent studies.\\n\\nFor example, according to a 2019 report published by Emgage, its \"Get Out The Vote\" efforts contributed to a 22 percent increase in voter turnout during the 2018 primaries in Florida.\\n\\nBut the report makes no attempt to explain how it reached the conclusion that its efforts led voters to the polling station. Nor does it acknowledge that there are multiple organisations doing the same work, and that overall voter turnout in the 2018 midterm elections was the highest of any midterm election in more than 100 years.\\n\\nIn explaining the methodology to MEE, Alzayat says:\\n\\n\"We conduct our \\'Get out the Vote\\' work by engaging likely Muslim voters who are in our voter database, then we review the files of those voters after the election to see whether they voted or not. This enables us to measure voter turnout and impact of our work, especially when we compare it to historical records.\"\\n\\nHe continues: \"Given our extensive work in this area and partnerships with local and national organisations, we take care to develop engagement strategies that allow the various organisations to focus on specific geographic areas. Without a doubt, many organisations (Muslim or otherwise) play a role in increasing voter turnout and whatever success that we are witnessing is a shared one.\\n\\n\"But Emgage is proud to conduct the largest number of phone calls, send out text messages, and place social media ads that target Muslim voters on a national scale.\"\\n\\nText messages and phone calls have become a staple of the group\\'s work. In a mass email sent out by Emgage on 28 September, reporting on its progress in getting a million Muslim votes, Alzayat writes in the subject line: \"1.7 MILLION Contacts With Muslim Voters\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We took on a very big task with our commitment to turn out one million Muslim voters this November. But with the help of our supporters like you, we have accomplished incredible achievements to make our voices heard. So far, our efforts include sending 1.2 million text messages and making 500,000 calls. And we are just getting started!\" he wrote.\\n\\nCantu says the claims that text messages and phone calls actually make a difference is flawed. Phone calls are a hit and miss. During election season, Americans are text-bombed by campaigns, resulting in text message fatigue.\\n\\n\"I have witnessed these phone banks. If they make 30 dials, they actually have one conversation,\" Cantu said, adding that, as someone who worked in Florida, she always found claims Emgage had that much influence over the Muslim community to be extremely exaggerated.\\n\\n\"I actually wondered: where are they getting these numbers from?\"\\n\\nGhabin says there are deeper holes in Emgage\\'s claims regarding its impact on the 2018 midterms in Florida.\\n\\nIn Tampa Bay, inside Hillsborough county, where Emgage claims to have helped raise voter turnout by 22 percent, Ghabin says the organisation was not allowed to operate at the two largest mosques where voter engagement, including registration, traditionally takes place.\\n\\n\"They had no presence and nobody knew them. But they came in wanting to use our existing relations with the community to sign up voter registrations. But the mosques didn\\'t want them because they knew of their links with MLI,\" Ghabin says.\\n\\nCantu, the former Emgage employee, confirmed Ghabin\\'s claims that Emgage is often turned away from mosques in parts of Florida.\\n\\n\"Besides one or two mosques, they are simply not welcome at others,\" she said. Emgage did not respond to MEE\\'s requests for comment on this specific matter.\\n\\nFrom Bernie to Biden\\n\\nIn February 2020, Emgage endorsed Bernie Sanders, then among the frontrunners in the race for the Democratic nomination after a succession of strong performances in the early primaries.\\n\\n\\n\\nSanders had addressed the Islamic Society of North America\\'s (ISNA) conference in 2019 and was well regarded in Muslim communities, and to have endorsed any other candidate at the time would have been a strategic blunder.\\n\\nEmgage\\'s endorsement of Sanders did endear Muslims otherwise sceptical of Emgage, but this was short-lived.\\n\\nJust four days before endorsing Sanders, Farooq Mitha, the co-founder of Emgage, held a fundraiser for Biden, highlighting what commentators and observers say is part of a pattern of contradictions by the organisation.\\n\\nIt is unclear why the Sanders\\' campaign made a point of highlighting Emgage\\'s endorsement, given that other organisations, such as the Muslim Caucus of America, had already endorsed him almost 20 days earlier. More importantly, there was very little about Emgage - its leadership or its agenda - that actually was in sync with Sanders and his left-wing agenda on healthcare, inequality, or the economy.\\n\\nIt is an honor to receive the endorsement of @EmgageAction. While Donald Trump has demonized our Muslim communities, our movement is working to bring Muslims and people of all backgrounds into the political system. https://t.co/ionlJecKzP — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) February 20, 2020\\n\\nAnd whereas Sanders might have said it was \"an honour\" to receive an endorsement from Emgage, community organisers note that in reality it was Emgage that benefited from the visibility created by Sanders.\\n\\nFaiz Shakir, Sanders\\' campaign manager, did not reply to MEE\\'s question as to why Emgage was seen as an important endorsement for Sanders\\' presidential campaign.\\n\\nMore contradictions were to come.\\n\\nIn March, the Biden campaign came under intense pressure after it was revealed that its Muslim outreach coordinator was a vehement supporter of India\\'s right-wing Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\\n\\nAmit Jani, who had been appointed in late 2019 as Biden\\'s Asian-American Pacific Islander (AAPI) outreach coordinator, also had the Muslim community in his portfolio.\\n\\nWho is Amit Jani and what is his relationship with Indian PM Narendra Modi? + Show - Hide Amit Jani is political operator from New Jersey. He previously worked for New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy\\'s 2017 campaign as well as Senator Bob Menendez\\'s 2018 campaign. He then moved to Governor Murphy\\'s office before joining the Biden campaign in September 2019 as his Asian-American Pacific Islander (AAPI) national vote director. Jani\\'s appointment drew outrage among Indian Muslims in particular who pointed out that his family have a long relationship with India\\'s right-wing BJP government, the Hindu-paramilitary organisation known as the RSS, as well as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Jani\\'s late father, Suresh, reportedly came from the same village as Modi, and they has originally met at an event organised by the Hindu paramilitary organisation, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Suresh later became one of the founders of Overseas Friends of BJP (OFBJP) in the United States, and the family hosted Modi at their home in New Jersey in 1993. Amit Jani\\'s family has a long history with Indian PM Narendra Modi [Facebook] Jani is an avid supporter of Modi. In 2014 blog published on Huffington Post, Jani compared Modi to former President Barack Obama. \"Modi and Obama have brought fresh voices and creative ideas to their governments, after many years of having increasingly unpopular and disconnected leaders in office. What I find most impressive amongst both leaders’ backgrounds is their humble upbringing and their ability to connect with the middle and working classes.\" Following the re-election of Modi in 2019, Jani posted images on Facebook celebrating the BJP\\'s victory and following Indian government\\'s revokation of Kashmir\\'s semi-autonomy, Jani was listed as an organiser for an event honouring the development. He has never disavowed his relations with Modi or the BJP.\\n\\nUnder pressure, the Biden campaign turned to Emgage\\'s Mitha, who had in 2016 become the Muslim outreach director for Hillary Clinton\\'s presidential campaign, for assistance. He eventually took on the role.\\n\\nThis meant that in March, Emgage was endorsing Sanders even while its co-founder was the Muslim outreach coordinator for Biden.\\n\\nAccording to Emgage, an informal survey of the organisation\\'s members and email list users found nearly 75 percent of its members supported Sanders.\\n\\n\"From where we\\'re sitting and what we\\'ve seen, it doesn\\'t seem that any major candidate has reached out in the same way,\" Alzayat said of Sanders.\\n\\nBut when Biden became the presumptive nominee in April, Emgage immediately endorsed him.\\n\\nGiven that endorsing Trump was not an option for most Muslim Americans, the immediate endorsement of Biden felt to many as if Emgage had in effect relinquished the desire to make Biden work for the votes it claimed it could help win. And in doing so, Emgage expected the Muslim American community to immediately fall into line, too.\\n\\n\"They became his spokesperson,\" Hussain says. \"And the Biden campaign got the token Muslims who wouldn\\'t raise difficult topics.\"\\n\\nMitha was subsequently referred to in the mainstream media as Biden\\'s Muslim outreach manager and Emgage began representing itself as the Muslim organisation with access to Biden, releasing exclusive comments from Biden to the media and co-hosting events, without ever mentioning that its co-founder and board member was the go-between.\\n\\nAs part of a cohort of questions sent to Biden prior to endorsement, Emgage asked the former vice-president to list \"Muslim or minority groups and leaders\" that had endorsed him.\\n\\n\"I am proud to have the support of Farooq Mitha, Emgage PAC co-founder and board member, Dilawar Syed, Emgage PAC board member, and Mallak Beydoun, senior official, Office of Mayor Duggan, Detroit,\" Biden said, before mentioning others.\\n\\nAccording to Emgage, Mitha had sent a note asking for a leave of absence in February 2020. But Emgage\\'s staff page listed Mitha as a board member until the page was taken down in September 2020.\\n\\nNeither Mitha nor Emgage responded to MEE\\'s request for written proof that his period of absence began in February 2020.\\n\\nEmgage and the ADL\\n\\nSince the Electronic Intifada accused Emgage of being a pro-Israel outfit, concerned Muslim Americans have been reaching out to the organisation to seek clarity on its relationships with other groups outlined in EI\\'s expose.\\n\\nFor its part, Emgage released a statement on its recently created Medium page, rather than its official website, in which it affirmed \"its commitment to Palestinians\" and addressed what it described as \"false claims\".\\n\\nBut Emgage did not address allegations that it had links with the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a pro-Israel organisation that in August was the subject of an open letter signed by more than 100 activist groups accusing it of \"a history and ongoing pattern of attacking social justice movements led by communities of color, queer people, immigrants, Muslims, Arabs, and other marginalized groups, while aligning itself with police, right-wing leaders, and perpetrators of state violence\".\\n\\nWhen the outrage did not abate, Wahid addressed the Muslim American community in a letter posted on the Emgage website. In his attempt to quell the rising anger, Wahid chose to mitigate the issue by explaining that Emgage had no \"programming\" with the ADL. Emgage now has a section on its website, called \"Fact and Fiction about Emgage\" that says the organisation has no formal links with the ADL.\\n\\nBut in March, in an interview with MEE, Wahid spoke candidly about Emgage and the ADL, characterising the relationship with the ADL as \"transactional\":\\n\\n\\'Don\\'t work with Anti-Defamation League,\\' progressive groups urge Read More »\\n\\n\"With the ADL - what folks don\\'t realise, and being a criminal defence lawyer, I know - is that in the judicial world, in the world of law enforcement and judges, the ADL has a very loud voice, and if you are not engaging them on some of these issues, you are ceding that territory and you are allowing them to put misinformation out to law enforcement and judges who make decisions about those who come before them.\"\\n\\nTo illustrate his point, he cited two examples in which Emgage had worked with the ADL.\\n\\n\"There was an anti-Sharia bill coming up in Florida [in 2014]. We had beaten it back three years in a row. In the fourth year, it seemed to have enough momentum that it was going to pass,\" Wahid said.\\n\\n\"The language was very problematic. So we built a coalition. Part of the coalition was the ADL.\"\\n\\nWahid says the ADL had joined the coalition because a portion of the proposed bill would have impacted the Jewish community.\\n\\nThe amended bill did pass but, he says, they \"were able to knock the teeth out of it\".\\n\\nThe second time they worked together followed the ADL publishing a report in which it characterised certain incidents as \"Muslim terrorism\".\\n\\nWahid said he had met with the ADL over the report and had pushed back on the issue, resulting in the two organisations having a sustained dialogue on similar issues.\\n\\n\"So before they would push some of these things out, they would have conversations with us, to get our viewpoint. And in some of those situations, it meant they decided no, its not appropriate to include this particular incident as so called \\'terrorism\\'. On other occasions, they didn\\'t listen to us and they did what they were going to do,\" Wahid said.\\n\\nKhurrum Wahid co-founded Emgage in 2006 (Azad Essa/MEE)\\n\\n\"But at least we were having some dialogue and some positive impact.\\n\\n\"The ADL is not going anywhere... We have to engage them on a certain level, it doesn\\'t mean we are partnering with them [and] we are not allies in all that we do, but to the extent that we can continue a dialogue with groups such as that, that aren\\'t going anywhere, and that have a very profound impact on criminal justice... it is important for us to look out for our community and engage.\"\\n\\nWahid said he understood that the optics of working with the ADL was problematic but \"sometimes substance has got to take priority over the optics\".\\n\\n\"Sometimes when you lead, you\\'re stepping into a space that others aren\\'t willing to follow.\"\\n\\nHe added that Emgage would work, within limits, with any organisation, including the police and elected officials who don\\'t agree with the community, if they felt that that engagement could help improve integration, equality and opportunity for Muslim Americans.\\n\\n\"And whether or not we get tarred by some in our community as being the so-called Uncle Toms in our community, I don\\'t think that is our primary driver.\"\\n\\nWahid\\'s perspective cuts to the heart of a culture war playing out in the US in which there is an increasing schism between those who say they are willing to open dialogue with \"problematic\" organisations and individuals, and those who believe that engaging with organisations actively working to demonise or assail your community is untenable.\\n\\nOver the past month though, Emgage staff have embarked on a project of scrubbing their websites and profiles of connections with work linked with the ADL or AIPAC (the American Israel Public Affairs Committee lobbying group).\\n\\nUntil September 2020, Wahid\\'s profile on his own law firm website described him as a member of the ADL civil rights committee in Miami. This has since disappeared. Alzayat told MEE that Wahid left the position in 2018.\\n\\nEmgage, MLI and faithwashing\\n\\nThe Muslim Leadership Initative programme has been a major point of contention in the Muslim American community ever since it was first launched in 2014.\\n\\nThe programme, formed by Abdallah Antepli, a Muslim chaplain at Duke University, and the Shalom Hartman Institute of North America, an Israeli think-tank, attempts to position the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a dispute between two religious groups. The MLI project involves academic study and a trip to Israel in which Muslim American \"leaders\" are given an opportunity to learn more about Judaism and Zionism.\\n\\nPalestinians, in particular, have opposed the programme, calling MLI a \"faithwashing\" project for its attempt to recast Israel\\'s ongoing settler-colonial project as a religious conflict between Muslims and Jews, a conflict that has \"two sides\". Moreover, Palestinians have repeatedly argued that participating in the project would contravene the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign, and further efforts towards \"normalisation\" with Israel.\\n\\nAlumni of the MLI programme have gone on to narrate their \"re-education\" as Muslims confronting the Israeli-Palestinian crisis in TIME Magazine and The Atlantic.\\n\\nAt least four people within Emgage, including Wahid, are alumni of MLI.\\n\\nFollowing Electronic Intifada\\'s resurrection of these MLI skeletons, Emgage purportedly tried to clarify that as, an organisation, it never had a relationship with MLI, but individuals had travelled in a personal capacity - and that it had since adopted a policy that prohibited members of Emgage from participating in the programme.\\n\\nBut, even here, basic details about this resolution are not particularly clear.\\n\\nIn March, Wahid told MEE that the community response to MLI had compelled them to pass the resolution that banned board members from participating in the Zionist normalisation programme.\\n\\nOn 3 September, Emgage said in a statement that the resolution applied to board members, staff and committee members, and was passed in 2018.\\n\\nIn his letter addressed to the Muslim community on 16 September, published on Emgage\\'s website, he wrote the resolution was passed in February 2019.\\n\\nCommunity activists say Emgage is disconnected from grassroots mobilisation of Muslims (Azad Essa/MEE)\\n\\nEmgage did not respond to MEE\\'s request for the minutes of the board meeting to ascertain when the resolution was passed.\\n\\nObservers note the resolution that was supposedly passed in 2018 or in 2019 was also never made public, until it was uploaded in September 2020 as an unlinked and near-undiscoverable document on the site.\\n\\nBut those familiar with the wider concepts of faithwashing say Emgage is engaging in semantics when it insists the MLI programme was always outside the ambit of the organisation.\\n\\nIn other words, even if Emgage no longer allows staff or board members, even in their personal capacity, to take part in programmes like MLI, those who have already participated in MLI remain still on staff, on the board, directing the activities of the organisation. Moreover, the organisation has yet to disavow itself from the pro-Israel, faithwashing ecosystem in which it has resided for much of its existence.\\n\\nEmgage\\'s insistence that it has no joint work with Zionist organisations is also not entirely accurate, given the individuals and organisations it welcomes into its orbit.\\n\\nFor instance, in 2018, at its annual policy conference, titled \"Upholding our Values: A Commitment to Tolerance,\" Emgage hosted Robert Silverman, then-US director of Muslim-Jewish relations of the American Jewish Committee, as a guest.\\n\\nExplaining his role at the AJC in 2016, Silverman said that part of his role was \"to move beyond nice discussions and interfaith gatherings at a local level\".\\n\\n\"They are uplifting and important and there\\'s quite a bit of Muslim-Jewish engagement going on. But we\\'ve got to scale it up to form real networks to do policy advocacy on a national level,\" he said. \"We will also work on a better understanding of Israel among Muslim Americans.\"\\n\\nEarlier this week, the same Silverman wrote in support of a new bill in the Senate that promotes normalisation with Israel.\\n\\nDespite the obvious, often public and unapologetic agenda of these faithwashing engagements, Emgage remains represented, through Alzayat, at the Muslim Jewish Advisory Council, a project between the AJC and the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) which, incidentally, began around the same time as Silverman\\'s appointment.\\n\\n\\'Good Muslims\\'\\n\\nBut Emgage has bigger ideological problems to confront than interfaith trojan horses.\\n\\nSeveral activists point to Alzayat\\'s career as emblematic of the organisation\\'s tendency to cheerlead some of the most conservative elements of American foreign policy.\\n\\nAlzayat routinely points to his position as a senior adviser to Samantha Power, the former US ambassador to the UN, but before this, he held several positions in Iraq during the American occupation of the country.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first was as the Provincial Affairs Officer for Anbar Province at the US embassy in Baghdad in 2007-8.\\n\\nAlzayat \"provided policy and operational guidance to Provincial Reconstruction Teams in Fallujah, Ramadi and al-Asad\" during \"the Surge,\" when then-president George W Bush sent additional troops to Iraq to quell a spike in violence. \"The Surge\" had catastrophic implications for Iraq. Alzayat also worked on the Egypt desk, as well as for the US ambassador to Iraq during the US military withdrawal.\\n\\nThough Emgage has no policy on Iran, Alzayat is also known to invoke Israeli talking points when speaking on Iran.\\n\\nIn 2017, Alzayat wrote for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP), a group linked to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which pushes neoconservative US national interests in the Middle East: \"The US has tried the other \\'resorts\\' already, with the Obama strategy of building on the Iranian nuclear agreement and then Secretary of State John Kerry\\'s shuttle diplomacy on Syria to restrain Iran by accommodating Iranian and Russian interests without recourse to force. This strategy has failed.\\n\\n\"Consequently, the Administration needs urgently a comprehensive approach toward Iran, centered in Syria and Iraq, including military means, to restore regional stability. Otherwise, new disasters, fueling extremism and likely new WMD programs, will emerge.\"\\n\\nWhereas Alzayat\\'s name was listed on WINEP\\'s website as an expert as recently as August, this has since been removed from their site.\\n\\nWINEP did not reply to MEE\\'s request as to why his profile was scrubbed from their site.\\n\\nIn July 2020, during a discussion on Biden\\'s Israel-Palestine policy on Israeli channel i24, Alzayat, identified as CEO of Emgage, said \"while [Biden] does not support conditioning aid to Israel - as an ally in the region - a region that, you know, has Iran and [Syrian dictator] Bashar al-Assad, and all of these unhelpful actors, but he is troubled and he has said that he will oppose the annexation of the West Bank\".\\n\\nSamantha Power: Idealism in service of empire Azad Essa Read More »\\n\\nFor decades, US foreign policy in the Middle East has pivoted around Israeli interests, and Alzayat\\'s approach to the Israel-Palestine conflict appears little different.\\n\\nIn a later question about Biden\\'s policy that would not reverse Trump\\'s decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem, Alzayat prefaced his answer with: \"We welcome the affirmation of the Jewish people\\'s right to have an embassy- not an embassy- but a capital in Jerusalem,\" before going on to say that Biden\\'s policy was \"contradictory,\" because \"it does not mention the Palestinian rights and aspiration for at least East Jerusalem\".\\n\\nEmgage repeatedly says it opposes \"Trump\\'s decision to move the embassy to Jerusalem,\" so it is unclear who Alzayat speaks for when he welcomes \"the right of the Jewish people to have an embassy in Jerusalem\". Emgage also repeatedly describes the US embassy move as \"Trump\\'s decision\". It is also unclear if this will change, given that Biden made it abundantly clear that he has no intention to move the embassy back to Tel Aviv, endorsing Trump\\'s decision.\\n\\nAlzayat\\'s comments suggest Emgage has endorsed it, too.\\n\\nObservers note that this exchange is a prime example of how Emgage operates and engages with power.\\n\\nAlzayat\\'s passing reference to \"the Iranian threat\" in a discussion about Biden\\'s conservative approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict also speaks directly to the establishment, and clearly views the rules of engagement through the lens of US and Israeli foreign policy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I am not sure why some people think they can \\'reform\\' this organisation when it is led by these types of people,\" one prominent Muslim-American activist, who asked not to be named, told MEE.\\n\\nLikewise, Samia Assed, an activist from New Mexico and a Democratic Party delegate, told MEE that tokenised engagements such as MLI and MJAC had paved the way for \"good Muslims\" with whom Israel, the US power base, and their proponents, are happy to negotiate.\\n\\n\"As a Muslim American organisation they still haven\\'t said \\'Zionism is racism\\'. This should be normal for a Muslim organisation,\" said Assed. \"There are Jewish organisations that are anti-Zionist. Why can\\'t Emgage commit to that?\\n\\n\"Emgage also say they support BDS as an American right, but they haven\\'t said \\'you should boycott an illegal occupation\\'.\"\\n\\n\"They have to step up, or step away. It is as simple as that.\"\\n\\nShe says MLI divided the Muslim community, misrepresented the Israeli occupation, and turned ordinary demands for Palestinian human rights, dignity and self determination into \"unreasonable\" and \"radical\" positions.\\n\\n\"It is clear they made these concessions when they went into these partnerships. And there is almost a disconnect when you call them out on BDS. It is as if they don\\'t know what you are talking about,\" Assed said.\\n\\n\"There is an obvious type of grooming that keeps them out of the mainstream concerns, the everyday concerns of Muslims on the street,\" Assed added.\\n\\nActivists are particularly worried now that Emgage is coordinating the hiring process of Muslim staffers in a potential Biden presidency.\\n\\n\"The big problem with Emgage is that they have primed themselves for these big leadership roles, but they skipped over the grassroots organising, and the work and the familiarity to the concerns of people on the ground.\" Assed says.\\n\\nNazia Kazi is an associate professor of anthropology at Stockton University in New Jersey.\\n\\n\"These figures offer the guise of interfaith dialogue, Muslim visibility, or the chance to have a \\'seat at the table\\' as a gloss for alliances with the state,\" she said.\\n\\n\"In my book, I write about \\'US Empire\\'s Good Muslim Cheerleaders\\'. By this, I mean the ranks of Muslims who silence, sidestep or disregard tackling the most egregious elements of American imperialism in exchange for visibility and legitimacy in the US racial order.\\n\\n\"I remain unsurprised at the cadre of Muslim Americans eager to step up in defence of US empire-building,\" Kazi adds.\\n\\nEndorsing pro-Israel candidates\\n\\nMiddle East Eye has found that Emgage has endorsed at least 20 pro-Israel candidates competing in November\\'s elections, calling into the question the organisation\\'s agenda and vetting process.\\n\\nOut of the 41 congressional candidates endorsed by Emgage in 2020, MEE found at least 12 Congressional incumbents who co-sponsored or voted against the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions Movement (BDS) in Congress in 2019, had taken multiple sponsored trips to Israel, and collectively received upwards of $621,697 from the pro-Israel lobby since 2017.\\n\\nIn this election cycle, Emgage has endorsed more than 50 candidates across 10 states running for city council, state legislature or Congress.\\n\\nEmgage has also endorsed candidates such as Robert Wittenberg, a state representative from Michigan who co-sponsored an anti-BDS bill that in 2016 made the boycott of Israel illegal in Michigan. Tom Malinowski, a Congressman from New Jersey, who openly supported the US embassy move to Jerusalem, has also been endorsed by Emgage, with its PAC contributing $1,500 to Malinowsky\\'s campaign in 2018.\\n\\nAccording to Wael Alzayat, CEO of Emgage, the organisation assesses \"candidates based on their history of engagement with the Muslim community, their viability as a candidate, their positions on issues, and track record\".\\n\\nBut he did not respond to queries as to how endorsing candidates that oppose BDS or support the embassy move to Jerusalem fit in with the organisation\\'s values.\\n\\nEmgage has tried to present the personal politics of its board members, such as the MLI trips or personal relations with the ADL, as separate to the goals of the organisation, but positions taken by Emgage, community organisers say, are more often than not categorically linked to the worldview and agendas of its most visible leaders.\\n\\nIt is the board members\\' personal relationships that have provided Emgage with access to elite political spaces as well as greater amplification in the media.\\n\\nAnd when these engagements buttress with Emgage\\'s endorsements of openly Zionist candidates for state legislature or Congress, community organisers and scholars say Emgage\\'s pursuit of a seat at the table often really means endorsing policies that contravene community sentiment. The endorsement of pro-Israel candidates cannot be seen as independent to the group\\'s cultural and political proximity to the MLI, the ADL and the AJC.\\n\\nThe latest revelations come as Muslim Americans come to terms with an alleged attempt by several Muslim organisations to shield it from criticism following the publication of the Electronic Intifada expose.\\n\\nThe article set off a firestorm among community activists already deeply concerned by Emgage\\'s rising influence and dissatisfied with their purported control over matters of importance to the Muslim community within the Biden campaign.\\n\\nOn 10 September, a group of activists and scholars wrote an open letter to mainstream Muslim American organisations, including the Council for American Islamic Relations and the civic action group MPower Change, currently working with Emgage in the \"Million Muslim Votes\" initiative, to cease all relations with the organisation.\\n\\nBut Muslim civil and political advocacy organisations have been hesitant to condemn Emgage in public.\\n\\nBehind the scenes, in WhatsApp groups and email listservs, a battle is raging between progressive Muslim activists, establishment Muslim Democrats, as well as some older organisers in the community over how to proceed with their relationships with the organisation.\\n\\nWhereas younger activists, many of whom are Bernie Sanders supporters, are calling for immediate action, those working with Emgage claim that any criticism of their work so close to the election \"is an act of voter suppression\".\\n\\nMeanwhile, other activists have urged the community to prioritise dethroning Trump.\\n\\nBut the ambiguity from leading Muslim American organisations has also been compounded by the recent unveiling of an alleged \"pact\" between a group of Muslim organisations calling on each other to protect themselves from attacks, and has raised the spectre of a culture of unaccountability and lack of transparency among Muslim American organisations.\\n\\n\\'Mutual defense pact\\'\\n\\nAccording to an email seen by MEE, a day after the petition urging organisations to #DropEmgage was created, Abbas Barzegar, CAIR\\'s national research and advocacy director, wrote to a group of Muslim organisers urging them to \"activate a mutual defense pact\".\\n\\n\"We need to coordinate to help our brothers and sisters at Emgage. Legitimate political critique is spiraling into destructive action that threatens our entire community,\" Abbas wrote in the email.\\n\\n\"We said this was effectively a mutual defense pact. We need to make good on it.\"\\n\\nFor many activists, the email served as proof that the lack of definitive action by leading Muslim organisations, as well as the tacit defence of Emgage on listservs and private WhatsApp groups, was part of a coordinated attempt to mute any public critique of the organisation.\\n\\nDespite the pressure exerted on the Muslim organisations, the vast majority have steered clear from the topic.\\n\\nEarlier this week, the US Council of Muslim Organisations, which Emgage joined in 2019, said that it had been working over the past month to investigate the concerns raised about Emgage.\\n\\n\"Despite strong efforts by everyone involved and some progress, we were not able to reach agreement. As a result, Emgage is no longer a member of USCMO.\"\\n\\nShortly after USCMO\\'s statement was released, Alzayat wrote on his Facebook page: \"We were not kicked out. Emgage resigned. This organisation doesn\\'t get bullied.\"\\n\\nBut it is unclear why USCMO had allowed Emgage to join their council in the first place.\\n\\nOussama Jamaal, USCMO\\'s secretary-general, initially agreed to talk to MEE but subsequently did not return MEE\\'s calls.\\n\\nBarzegar, for his part, has insisted that despite there being a pledge among the organisations \"to help protect each other from Islamophobic attacks from right-wing extremists,\" there was \"no mutual defense pact\".\\n\\nHe told MEE that his email was not an attempt to quell open critique of Emgage.\\n\\nBarzegar said the listserv he had sent it to was called the Muslim Civic Engagement Table (MCET), a loose grouping of representatives of Muslim organisations, including CAIR, MPower Change, MPAC, Poligon and others, who had decided in early 2019 to pool resources towards getting more Muslims out to vote.\\n\\nHe also said he sent the email in his personal capacity - even though he was on the group as a representative of CAIR.\\n\\nMEE has not been able to independently ascertain the extent of coordinated efforts to protect Emgage. However, none of the lead organisations on MCET or its leadership have spoken publicly about the serious allegations pitted against the group.\\n\\nAccording to the Institute of Social Policy and Understanding, Muslim American approval of President Trump has been consistently lower than other groups (Azad Essa/MEE)\\n\\nBarzegar\\'s email also followed an incident in August - in which CAIR edited out comments critical of Emgage from a video featuring Palestinian scholar and activist Sami al-Arian.\\n\\nAl-Arian, a former political prisoner in the US who was eventually deported to Turkey, had described Emgage as \"trying to infiltrate the community\".\\n\\n\"We need to speak about this and not allow those people who have [an] agenda that aligns with Zionist imperatives in America and make them a spokesperson for us,\" he said. \"I think our people need to wake up and stand up for justice. We are not going to be empowered by simply kissing the hands - or the behinds - of the people in power today.\"\\n\\nBarzegar tendered his resignation in late August and left CAIR at the end of September.\\n\\nSamia Assed told MEE that several organisations might have been driven by the Muslim community\\'s inclination to \"give people the benefit of doubt\".\\n\\n\"There might have been internal talk about bringing them in and educating them. I can see how that is tempting,\" said Assed, who admitted she was open to working with Emgage before she read the Electronic Intifada piece in early September.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t know the extent to which they were involved with things like MLI, because they kept on distancing themselves, and they kept on saying they support Palestine, but the paper trail now shows otherwise,\" Assed, who signed the open letter against Emgage, said.\\n\\nAs a PAC, Emgage is not a very large or influential one. In the 2020 election cycle, Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings indicate it has made contributions totalling $20,000 to no more than five candidates. It has instead focused on demonstrating support and facilitating fundraising events for candidates.\\n\\nBut since 2016, Emgage Action has received funding from the Open Society Foundation, culminating in a $1 million grant in 2019 to support, in part, their \"Get Out The Vote\" efforts. According to its 2018 annual report, 69 percent of its budget came from grant money, further exemplifying its disconnect from the community\\'s grassroots.\\n\\nEmgage\\'s access to this grant money, as well as other resources, such as voter data, also appears to have compelled older and more established Muslim organisations to keep working with it. MEE has not been able to independently verify if this is the case, and if so, why other Muslim organisations have not been able to access this data.\\n\\nMEE also understands that CAIR and MPower Change in particular, had agreed to work with Emgage and MPAC following a consensus among the Muslim Civic Engagement Table that they would steer clear from initiatives that threaten the Muslim community, specifically the Muslim Leadership Initiative, Countering Violence and Extremism programme (CVE) and the anti-BDS movement, seen as non-negotiables in the Muslim community.\\n\\n\"When they agreed to sign on, it was more likely that CAIR thought the group would be activated to defend them, given the number of attacks they face by Islamophobic groups, and not the other way around,\" a community leader familiar with MCET said.\\n\\nA senior member in CAIR confirmed to MEE that they had decided to work with Emgage, \"because they thought [Emgage] could change\".\\n\\nBut Ahmed Bedier, a longtime community organiser in Florida, told MEE that, ultimately, Muslim American organisations would have to own responsibility for their part in the episode.\\n\\n\"Emgage derive their legitimacy from their proximity to power - and the critical thing here, though, is they would not have managed to secure this legitimacy with Biden if they hadn\\'t managed to secure partnerships with the USCMO and other established Muslim organisations.\\n\\n\"Everything changed for Emgage when they managed to persuade a 25-year-old established national organisation like CAIR to come under their \\'million Muslim vote\\' campaign,\" said Bedier, who hosts a weekly radio show on Tampa NPR affiliate WMNF.\\n\\n\"This gave them an entirely different level of legitimacy with the Biden campaign, and they turned around and used that access to power to push themselves onto and gain legitimacy with a community that didn\\'t know them.\"\\n\\nThe executive branches of Mpower Change and CAIR declined to comment on Abbas\\' email.\\n\\nPoligon and MPAC also did not respond to MEE\\'s request for comment, while MPAC has continued to demonstrate public support for Emgage.\\n\\nBrown skins, white masks\\n\\nWith less than a month left until November\\'s elections, tensions and anxieties over a second Trump presidency are overflowing.\\n\\nFor many within the Muslim community, the idea of Trump returning is unimaginable.\\n\\nThe so-called Muslim ban, in its different iterations, has split families, destroyed livelihoods and set back communities emotionally and psychologically. Trump’s courting of white supremacists has seen a rise in hate crimes and xenophobia. Indian-American Muslims look at Modi\\'s second term - in which he introduced anti-Muslim citizenship laws, and abrogated the semi-autonomy of Kashmir - and wonder if a Trump second term could see their naturalisation revoked, or more Muslims banned from the country.\\n\\nTrump\\'s volatility is fodder for a nervous imagination.\\n\\nAnd yet, Biden\\'s campaign has yet to provide any real comfort, either.\\n\\nIn June, Palestinian American activists staged a virtual walkout of a meeting with Mitha over the campaign\\'s approach to Palestine.\\n\\n\"We are being told we should be grateful that Biden is even recognising the Palestinian conflict. This is not how you get people to believe in your candidate,\" said one of the activists who walked off the call.\\n\\nLikewise, over the past six months, Indian-American Muslims in particular have tried to engage Mitha and Emgage about their concerns that his colleague Jani, a longtime supporter of Indian PM Modi, was organising within the Asian community, including Indian and Pakistani American Muslims.\\n\\nIn August, some among the Pakistani-American community were jolted when they realised their independence day event with the Biden campaign had been organised by Jani. Multiple sources have told MEE that Mitha has repeatedly downplayed their concerns, defending Jani and describing him as a friend.\\n\\nWhereas Muslim Americans are gradually being told in off-the-record briefings that Biden\\'s policy on Palestine is \"not where we want it\" but \"it\\'s better than Trump,\" both Mitha and Emgage have yet to acknowledge that the Biden campaign continues to have a supporter of Hindu nationalism on his staff.\\n\\nThat Indian-American Muslims have been not been able to ascertain whether Mitha\\'s defence of Jani stems from the fact that Mitha\\'s role may still be an unpaid, stop-gap measure from the Biden campaign and that he might actually still be reporting to Jani is only grating them further.\\n\\nNeither the Biden campaign nor Mitha responded to MEE\\'s request for clarification either.\\n\\n\"I will vote for Biden. But we also know they aren\\'t serious about us. It will be like drinking poison,\" one Indian-American Muslim organiser who has heard Mitha recount different versions of his relationship with Jani, told MEE.\\n\\n\"And it\\'s only because a Trump second term could end up being disastrous for us. Look what Modi did during his second term. Who knows, Trump could reverse naturalisation, and then what will we do? We can\\'t afford it. We have no choice. And Mitha knows that,\" the organiser said.\\n\\nSeveral Indian-American Muslims from New York City and cities in Texas have expressed frustration with Emgage over its slow response to their demands to stop facilitating campaign funding to Sri Preston Kulkarni, a congressional candidate in Texas, who has reportedly accepted tens of thousands of dollars from Hindu nationalists in the US.\\n\\nEmgage had endorsed Kulkarni in 2018, but, following vehement pressure from the community this year, they decided against endorsing him ahead of the elections in November.\\n\\nAlzayat told MEE that Emgage had not been made aware in 2018 that Kulkarni had received funding from the Hindu right wing in 2018, despite community activists from Texas claiming otherwise. Kulkarni did not respond to MEE\\'s request for comment.\\n\\n\"It is unacceptable for any Muslim organisation to support candidates that take money from Israel or pro-Modi supporters,\" Sarsour from MPower Change told MEE, declining to comment further on the ongoing controversy surrounding Emgage.\\n\\nBut as the criticism mounts, Emgage\\'s leadership and its surrogates continue to insist that complaints against the organisation so close to the election amount to a vote for Trump.\\n\\n\"The ongoing attacks attempt to cast doubt about the fidelity of Emgage and the largest voter mobilisation effort in Muslim American history,\" Alzayet said.\\n\\n\"If enough voters are convinced that this effort is somehow nefarious, enough of them may stay home and not vote in November.\"\\n\\nOrganisers say that Emgage, dominated by South Asian and Arab Muslims, does not have much of a presence in Black Muslim communities (Azad Essa/MEE)\\n\\nAssed, the Palestinian American activist from New Mexico, said the assertion that criticising Emgage amounted to suppressing voters was \"an act of voter suppression itself\".\\n\\n\"It is a very pathetic argument. I am a member of the Democrat Party, I am organising day-in-and-day-out against Trump and fascism and white supremacy. Emgage can\\'t use that card to defend their alliances or partnerships with Zionists to hush up Muslim voices. This is in fact voter suppression,\" Assed said.\\n\\nAlzayat\\'s argument, though, is on repeat, in private circles, among members of organisations such as CAIR, too, who insist that they will hold Emgage and Biden accountable after the election.\\n\\nThey are being recycled in other circles, by Muslim Democratic Party operators displaced by Trump\\'s victory in 2016, and mainstream Muslim pundits, who see Emgage as their ticket to a White House iftaar.\\n\\nNone of the activists who spoke to MEE said they would vote for, or encourage others to vote for, Trump because of Emgage.\\n\\nMEE has also found no data to back up claims that critiquing Emgage would result in a lower Muslim turnout.\\n\\nAssed says the difference of opinion is really the story of two very different approaches to American power and the Muslim place inside America.\\n\\n\"Some of us want American politicians - whether Democrat of Republican - to know exactly what we want. We don\\'t want to present a washed down version of it. And we believe it is our right. This is what all of this is about,\" Assed said.\\n\\nKazi, also the author of Islamophobia, Race, and Global Politics, told MEE that Emgage\\'s approach to those critical of its efforts was only one of the methods used by the Democratic Party for decades. She says it is with a sense of deja vu that she recalls elections cycles from years past, in which \"we were met with desperate pleas that \\'this time it is the most important election, so please - set aside your agitation for now\\'.\"\\n\\n\"The Democratic party leadership consistently leans right, then shames those who cannot, in good conscience, cast a vote for a party that has not offered a substantive reason to do so.\\n\\n\"In fact, every four years bring the same rejoinders: that this is the most important election ever; let\\'s just vote them in first and then we\\'ll push them to do the right thing; that not voting for a Democrat is a vote for a Republican. People who remember past election cycles recognise such comments as efforts to quell dissent.\"\\n\\nKazi adds that people who remember history \"know full well that mass, collective action has done far more to push for social change than have any electoral politics\".\\n\\n\"Or perhaps more accurately, the movements force us to recognise the coziness of both parties on the very issues that impact the margins the most: warfare, foreign policy, labour, and criminal justice.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIn its American Muslim Poll 2020 report, released on 1 October, the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU), said that given that a quarter of Muslims in America are not eligible to vote (because they are not citizens), data suggest that even if 78 percent of Muslims eligible to vote have registered to do, the number of Muslims actually registered to vote in real terms is around 57 percent of the overall community.\\n\\n\"As 1% of the population, with a quarter not eligible to vote, voting in national elections may not be the most effective way to assert political influence,\" the ISPU said.\\n\\n\"The next generation of organisers may work to encourage greater participation in local political races where Muslims can make a difference with campaign contributions and volunteering, as well as voting.\"\\n\\nLikewise, Raja Abdulhaq, from the Majlis Ash-Shura: Islamic Leadership Council of New York, told MEE that the Emgage saga has already had more far-reaching implications than merely November\\'s vote.\\n\\nAbdulhaq says young Muslims who are increasingly speaking the language of intersectionality and are awake to the connections between racism, police brutality, American militarism and Palestinian rights, are likely to become even more disengaged from the political process.\\n\\n\"They look at organisations like Emgage and see through them. Then they look at the other groups who worked with Emgage and think that instead of being resolute, committed and brave to the causes that matter, they surrendered, too, and became complicit,\" Abdulhaq says. \"Any young person watching all of this play out will think to themselves, \\'what the hell is all of this?\\'\\n\\n\"It actually just takes the community backwards,\" Abdulhaq said. \"This is the tragedy.\"',\n",
              " 'Fears have grown of unrest among Iran\\'s Azeri minority after the government appeared to shift to a pro-Azerbaijan stance on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.\\n\\nSince the early days of fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Iran\\'s government has attempted to portray itself a neutral mediator - a role that it has assumed in past rounds of conflict over the disputed region on the country\\'s northern border.\\n\\nSaeed Khatibzade, the spokesperson for Iran’s foreign ministry, has spoken of the necessity of an “immediate ceasefire” before the beginning of new talks between Armenia and Azerbaijan.\\n\\n“The policy of Iran regarding this dispute hasn’t changed, and we are willing to help to facilitate the dialogue, and we believe that the military solution isn\\'t a lasting solution for resolving [such] issues,\" he said.\\n\\nFurthermore, Ali Rabie, the spokesperson for the government of Iran, announced that Tehran along with Moscow and Ankara could \"help the two neighbouring countries in implementing the UN resolutions to resolve their differences through peaceful ways.”\\n\\nHowever, since the fighting began there have been multiple street demonstrations by Azeris in Iran calling for support for their sibling state.\\n\\nThe Azeri community in Iran is the second largest ethnic group in the country, mostly centred around the northwestern provinces that border Azerbaijan.\\n\\nOn 1 October, Azeris in Tabriz - the capital city of East Azerbaijan province - took to the streets to declare their support for the “territorial integrity” of the Republic of Azerbaijan.\\n\\nOne day later, the representatives of Iran\\'s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to the four Azeri-majority provinces of Ardabil, Zanjan, Eastern Azerbaijan, and Western Azerbaijan, held a meeting, discussing the Nagorno-Karabakh crisis.\\n\\nShortly after they issued a joint statement, saying there was \"no doubt about Karabakh belonging to Azerbaijan and the necessity of its return to Azerbaijan.\\n\\n\"The people of Azerbaijan know best that the Islamic Republic provided the highest assistance and support to Azerbaijan during the occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh and defended the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan in all international circles,\" it read, continuing, \"had it not been for the Islamic Republic at the beginning of the occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh, the occupation would certainly have extended to Baku.\"\\n\\nThey also praised the “recent victories” of the Azerbaijan army.\\n\\n\\'Danger\\' of pan-Turkism\\n\\nIran\\'s policy of neutrality dates back three decades to the beginning of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in the early 90s.\\n\\nAt the time, Iran’s President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani managed to persuade the two sides to reach a ceasefire deal and their leaders to sit at the negotiation table. In the middle of the crisis, Rafsanjani visited Baku, where he was asked to enter the war along with Azerbaijan against Armenia. He turned down the request, preferring to continue his mediation attempts.\\n\\nThe 2 October statement, however, alongside the pro-Azerbaijan demonstrations, have provoked alarm among some Iranians, who fear that displays of support for Azerbaijan could risk stirring up ethnic tensions and even separatism.\\n\\nAzeris in Azerbaijan wave to Iranian Azeris gathered across the border at the Aras River, on 8 January 1990, West Azerbaijan Province (AFP)\\n\\nHamshahri, a reformist newspaper, said there was a risk of \"provocation of ethnic sentiments in some parts of the country.”\\n\\nThe Shargh newspaper also expressed its concerns over the consequence of this statement and the possible “abuse” of it by radical ethnic and separatist groups, while the Entekhab news site slammed the statements and the four representatives behind it for violating the “neutral” policy of Iran regarding the Karabakh crisis and the potential damage it could cause to Iran\\'s diplomatic relations.\\n\\nThe Azeri protest in Tabriz have also fuelled concerns about the rise of \"pan-Turkism,\" a political ideology that advocates union between the \"Turkic\" states such as Turkey, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.\\n\\nMasoud Mardomi, an Azeri living in West Azerbaijan Province, told Middle East Eye that the majority of Azeris were busy thinking about how to make ends meet in the middle of an economic crisis rather than the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.\\n\\n\"There are, however, about 20 percent that are affected by the propaganda of Turkish and Azerbaijani channels and would like Tehran to take Baku’s side,\" he added.\\n\\n\"And I think the representatives of Iran’s leader made a mistake by releasing that statement as it did strengthen this minority.”\\n\\nHe said that, overall, most Azeris in Iran were Iranian patriots and had no interest in \"pan-Turkist\" politics.\\n\\n“I have no doubt about what I’m saying that if the majority of Azeris cared about the current conflict, they would have passed the border and taken over [Armenia\\'s capital] Yerevan,\" he explained.\\n\\n\"You saw how we fought for our country in the eight-year war Iraq imposed on Iran.”\\n\\nArmenian concerns\\n\\nMeanwhile, Iran\\'s Armenian community - whose numbers are thought to range between 70,000 and 200,000 people - have generally had a muted reaction to the conflict, though some still desire to see their government putting forward a stronger defence of Artsakh, the ethnically Armenian administration that controls Nagorno-Karabakh.\\n\\n\\'Azerbaijan’s growing power will enhance Pan-Turkism inside Iran with the sole goal of disintegration, and we Armenians are fully against this\\' - Garegin Fataei, lawyer\\n\\nGaregin Fataei, an Iranian-Armenian lawyer, said the government had been forced to take a neutral position in order to balance the sentiment of a large number of Azeris in the country with the Islamic Republic\\'s warm relationships with Armenia.\\n\\n\"But the Armenians of Iran don’t like to see their country (Iran) to be the victim of Baku’s policies, because Azerbaijan’s growing power will enhance Pan-Turkism inside Iran with the sole goal of disintegration, and we Armenians are fully against this,\" he added.\\n\\nHe argued that, much like Iranian Azeris, Iran\\'s Armenians saw themselves first and foremost as Iranian.\\n\\n“We however are upset to see Iran asking Armenia to withdraw its forces from Karabakh - we know the Iranian government has strong reasons for supporting Armenians there.”\\n\\nIntegrity of Azerbaijan\\n\\nFollowing the controversy over the Azeri leaders\\' statement, Ali Akbar Velayati - a foreign policy advisor to the supreme leader - told the influential conservative newspaper Kayhan \"we are completely worried about the fate of Azerbaijan, and we believe that territorial integrity of it must be preserved and its occupied regions must be evacuated [by Armenian forces].”\\n\\nIran’s government took the same position, urging Armenia to withdraw its forces from the “occupied regions”.\\n\\nA reliable and knowledgeable source told MEE on condition of anonymity that the Iranian Azeri leaders had not acted \"independently\" and their statement was surely indicative of a change in attitude at the highest levels, as the four would never be \"allowed to make such decisions without any coordination”.\\n\\nThe apparent move in favour of the Azerbaijani position marks a shift in Iranian policy, which has in the past been seen as more favourable to Armenia.\\n\\nAnother analyst - also speaking on condition of anonymity - suggested that Azerbaijan had been pressuring Iran by promoting pan-Turkism and raising the spectre of ethnic separatism in the country.\\n\\n“They have strived to attract some people in Iran in order to pressure Tehran to change its policies. At the same time, in the high ranking levels in Tehran, they are active and lobbying,\" he said.\\n\\n“However, many believe that Iran’s change of position in favour of Azerbaijan was rooted in Tehran’s belief that Azerbaijan wouldn\\'t gain anything important in this war.”\\n\\nLife worries\\n\\nBeyond the geopolitical debate, the real-life impact of the conflict on neighbouring areas in Iran has been overlooked.\\n\\nArmenia-Azerbaijan conflict: Why Turkey is outsourcing its wars Read More »\\n\\nSince the conflict began, a considerable number of mortar shells have hit the border areas in the northwest of Iran.\\n\\nIran’s President Hassan Rouhani has warned Armenia and Azerbaijan to avoid inflicting any damage to border areas, but many of those affected feel their concerns are being ignored.\\n\\nMasoud Khodapanah, who lives in the village of Qoli Beiglou close to the Iran-Azerbaijan border, told MEE Armenian and Azerbaijani shelling was making life hard.\\n\\n\"A few days ago, three rockets landed here - one of them hit a paddy field, destroying five-months of work by its owner.

Hence, the first impression that most customers have is that I am trying to sell them beer,” the 29-year-old told CNA Lifestyle.\\n\\n“They are not entirely wrong!” she added with a laugh.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSingapore's first certified female beer brewmaster Crystalla Huang of RedDot Brewhouse. (Photo: Genevieve Loh)\\n\\nIndeed Huang, who oversees the Singapore operations at RedDot BrewHouse at Dempsey is in the business of trying to sell beer to people – in a manner of speaking.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe’s the brewmaster of the establishment, which is owned by her father Ernest Ng, a self-trained brewer and home brewer since 1997.\\n\\n“When I tell them (the customers) that I am a brewer, they would look surprised or some even are sceptical,” she shared. “Of course, many think that I brew coffee when I say I work as a brewer!”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHuang joined the family business six years ago after she finished brewing school in Berlin, Germany.\\n\\nCrystalla Huang is Singapore's first and only certified female brewmaster (Photo: Genevieve Loh)\\n\\n“One would need to go through a brewing university to receive certification,” she explained. “I received mine from VLB Berlin. There are many homebrewers or people who just brew without an education.”\\n\\nHuang, who has a Bachelor in Culinary Arts from the Culinary Institute of America, is officially Singapore’s first and only female certified brewmaster, among roughly 15 other brewmasters here.\\n\\nBeing a brewer, much less a female one, isn’t exactly a conventional career path. And it all came about for Huang when she was, in her own words, “a nosy, boisterous kid of seven years old”.\\n\\n“My dad was home brewing in our backyard then. I was just poking my nose in everything, from using a pasta machine to mill to throwing grains into a pot,” she shared.\\n\\n“When I finished O-levels at 16, RedDot BrewHouse opened its doors. I was roped in to help with the brewing. I fell in love again with the heat, pace, creativity and science of fermentation. From then on, I channelled my education path towards brewing.”\\n\\nCrystalla Huang is Singapore's first and only certified female brewmaster. (Photo: Genevieve Loh)\\n\\nBut being one of the few women in a male-dominated industry surely comes with its set of challenges. Like, say, the literal heavy-lifting – a typical bag of grains/malt weigh around 25kg while a keg of beer weighs around 42 kg.\\n\\nAccording to Huang, each time they brew, they use about 200kg grain.\\n\\n“Brewing is a physically demanding job and, naturally, some women would shun this job because of this,” she said. “To deal with this requirement, I try to stay physically fit and strong by doing a lot of sports to develop the fitness level needed to do this work.”\\n\\nSingapore's first certified female beer brewmaster Crystalla Huang of RedDot Brewhouse. (Photo: Genevieve Loh)\\n\\nAnd how often does “mansplaining” come into the picture?\\n\\n“Only in the past, when I was younger and more inexperienced,” said Huang. “But I think the alcohol industry is to be blamed for this. Young female sales ambassadors and sexily dressed promo girls are used to fuel the alcohol industry at large.”\\n\\nShe admitted that that when she was younger, she was “a greenhorn” and “asked stupid questions”.\\n\\nCrystalla Huang is Singapore's first and only certified female brewmaster. (Photo: Genevieve Loh)\\n\\n“So being mansplained was common until I gained enough experience and knowledge to talk sense. Over time, people learnt to respect me. But I think it is like that in any workplace. Nothing unusual.”\\n\\nHuang believes that in the end, it is “knowledge” that will be best used to overcome gender bias.\\n\\n“I do admit, women have it slightly harder, especially in very technical-dominated and male-dominated fields. We just have to try harder to prove ourselves,” she said.\\n\\nLike debunking the misconceptions of being a female brewmaster.\\n\\nSome of those she has faced thus far? She brews coffee. Or that she’s a bartender.\\n\\n“Or that I am just lucky or I am a lazy second-generation brewer from a brewing family,” she revealed. “Some even think I do not know how to brew. They think that I have hired a score of professional male brewers working behind me to ensure quality RedDot beer.”\\n\\n\\n\\nBut this hasn’t stopped Huang – and it shouldn’t either if other women are looking to join the industry.\\n\\nHer words of advice? For women to see the job and profession for what it is.\\n\\n“Do not put your gender bias on it or give excuses like women should not carry heavy things or that the job is too dirty for me or the guys can do it,” she said.\\n\\nSingapore's first certified female beer brewmaster Crystalla Huang of RedDot Brewhouse. (Photo: Genevieve Loh)\\n\\n“Do what your male counterparts do, put your head down, roll up your sleeves and just work. Have an open mind; believe in yourself that you can do it and do not be upset with anyone who doubts you. Be humble to learn even from even harsh words. And don’t carry emotional baggage.”\\n\\nWhen it comes to women flourishing in typically male-skewed industries, perhaps Huang best sums it up: “Women in the work force is a force not to be trifled with. After all, there is a reason why almost all hurricanes are named after females.”\",\n",

              " 'SINGAPORE: Veteran journalist Patrick Daniel will be the interim CEO for SPH Media Trust, the new entity that will be formed after Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) restructures its media business.\\n\\nMr Daniel was former deputy CEO of SPH and previously editor-in-chief of the company’s English/Malay/Tamil Media Group.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAnnouncing the appointment on Wednesday afternoon (May 12), Mr Khaw Boon Wan, who will chair the non-profit entity that is to oversee SPH Media Trust, said he expects the transition to be “uneventful”.\\n\\n“My immediate priority is to ensure a smooth transition, without any disruption to the current media business,” said Mr Khaw at a townhall with SPH employees.\\n\\n“Practically all 2,500 media and media-related staff of SPH will move over to SPH Media Trust.”\\n\\nReporters were invited to cover Mr Khaw\\'s opening speech to the employees. The townhall was then closed to the media.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSPH had announced last week that it will hive off its core media business amid falling advertising revenue.\\n\\nAll the media business units in the company will be transferred to a newly formed public company limited by guarantee (CLG), which will be run as a not-for-profit entity.\\n\\nSPH will provide the initial resources and funding to capitalise SPH Media with a cash injection of S$80 million, S$30 million worth of SPH shares and SPH REIT units, as well as SPH\\'s stakes in four of its digital media investments.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIt was announced in Parliament on Monday that Mr Khaw, a former Cabinet minister, will be chairman of the CLG.\\n\\nMANAGEMENT SHAREHOLDERS TO JOIN CLG\\n\\nIn his speech to SPH employees on Wednesday, Mr Khaw reiterated that the media business is unsustainable amid the severe disruption caused by digital media.\\n\\n\"It will be a struggle to sustain quality journalism as a public good,\" he said.\\n\\nDelisting SPH\\'s media business and transferring it to a CLG will allow it to retain the \"financial discipline of a commercial enterprise\" while also having the option of seeking funding from the Government and other sources for digital transformation, said Mr Khaw.\\n\\n\"The Government is willing to help SPH Media build capacity, pilot innovations and scale up to increase impact and outreach.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Public funding will have to be accounted for and will be directed at capacity building,\" said Mr Khaw. \"Such funding is already available to other media companies, including Mediacorp.\"\\n\\nThe nine management shareholders of SPH have been sounded out to form SPH Media Trust, said Mr Khaw,\\n\\nThey are OCBC, Great Eastern, UOB, DBS, Singtel, NTUC Income, Temasek via Fullerton, the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University.\\n\\n\"They have agreed to be the founding members of the CLG, to continue their mission of supporting quality journalism,\" said Mr Khaw in his speech.\\n\\nHe added that more trustees will join in due course and the planned cut-over date is Sep 1, \"at the earliest\".\\n\\nDIGITAL TRANSFORMATION\\n\\nMr Daniel retired on Sep 1, 2017, after three decades in the media industry. He held various positions at the company, including editor of the Business Times and editor-in-chief of the English/Malay/Tamil Media Group, before retiring as deputy chief executive of SPH.\\n\\nSPH said in 2017 that Mr Daniel was to continue as a part-time consultant and help CEO Ng Yat Chung in managing some SPH subsidiaries and projects.\\n\\nBefore joining the media, Mr Daniel was in the Singapore Government’s Administrative Service, where his last position was a director in the Ministry of Trade and Industry.\\n\\n\"I am grateful to Patrick for agreeing to help us out. Like me, he is enjoying his retirement. But he has a strong personal interest to see SPH Media succeed,\" said Mr Khaw in his speech, adding that he will begin a search for a CEO who \"can take SPH Media into the future as a multilingual digital media organisation\".\\n\\nAt a media conference later, Mr Khaw said the search for a longer-term CEO for the CLG will ideally be completed by next year, but noted that the right talent is not easy to find.\\n\\n“In terms of the kind of people we are looking for … I think it will be very hard to get a foreigner, to be able to instinctively understand what this Singaporean interest is all about,\" said Khaw in response to a question from CNA.\\n\\n“And ideally, therefore, I hope we can find one Singaporean who may not be here today, but maybe somewhere overseas. And hopefully - digitally savvy. Even better, if (the person comes) with actual digital media experience.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen asked how long he will remain interim CEO, Mr Daniel said: \"I\\'ll stay for as long as I\\'m needed.\"\\n\\nMr Khaw said he has started to meet SPH employees in small groups to listen to their concerns and aspirations, and will continue to do so over the next few weeks.\\n\\nHe highlighted a few initiatives after the transition that will help the media company meet future challenges, to enhance its digital products, grow a younger audience and boost its digital revenue.\\n\\nAn SPH Media Academy will be set up to train recruits and existing employees, build a \"first-class\" digital tech team and from next year, SPH Media will step up the award of SPH scholarships, which will be in digital disciplines as well as in journalism.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor current journalists, there will be fellowships and attachments in world-class newsrooms, he added.\\n\\n\"This is the start of a new chapter for SPH Media. The last time we had a major restructuring was in the early 1980s,\" said Mr Khaw. \"Now, the strategic objective remains the same - to preserve quality newspapers in all four languages trusted by readers, and to sustain them over the long term.\"\\n\\nThe transfer of SPH\\'s media assets to the CLG is subject to SPH shareholders\\' approval at an extraordinary general meeting to be convened at a later date.\\n\\n',\n",
              " 'SINGAPORE: Ensuring a smooth transition amid the restructuring, beefing up newsrooms and improving user experience for Singapore Press Holding’s (SPH) media products are among the key priorities for Mr Khaw Boon Wan, who will chair the entity overseeing SPH’s media business when it is hived off.\\n\\nSpeaking at a media conference on Wednesday (May 12), the former Cabinet minister said the new media business, SPH Media Trust, must be able to attract and retain skilled talent to achieve its goals of providing quality journalism.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“I heard that because of several years of cost pressures, some newsrooms ... may have been weakened or diminished in capacity or ability to retain good staff. We will use this opportunity to try to beef it up,” said Mr Khaw.\\n\\n“Pass the word around. If you know good writers out there who left last year or recently, and they are good team workers, bring them back … I’ll find the money to pay them, so we can enhance the newsroom and push on with what we need to do,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs for user experience, he said that access to digital products must be made more seamless and user-friendly. He also said he wants to “define customers more widely”, adding that he will be working to understand newsrooms’ workflows more intimately.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nEarlier at a townhall with SPH employees, Mr Khaw highlighted a few initiatives that will help the media company meet future challenges, enhance its digital products and grow a younger audience.\\n\\nThese include an SPH Media Academy that will be set up to train recruits and existing employees. SPH Media will step up the award of scholarships, which will be in digital disciplines as well as in journalism.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor current journalists, there will be fellowships and attachments in world-class newsrooms, Mr Khaw said in his speech.\\n\\nDuring the media conference, Mr Khaw was asked about his approach to ensuring editorial integrity, He said the ultimate goal is to make sure SPH continues to have products that people trust, which are fact-based and “understand Singapore’s interests at heart”.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“There are many factors to achieve this ... The quality of the newsroom is one, but equally, it\\'s the independence of the newsroom.\\n\\n“You undermine that – you undermine what we are trying to achieve. That is my position. To me, it is crystal clear,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nNATION-BUILDING OBJECTIVES\\n\\nA reporter also asked Mr Khaw about the role vernacular newspaper outlets will have in the new entity and the kind of resources they will be given.\\n\\nIn response, Mr Khaw said that these titles serve different audiences with varying market sizes.\\n\\nBut he added that “the metrics of measuring success and therefore resource allocation” to these outlets cannot just be seen in terms of dollars and cents, but also in the role they play in nation-building.\\n\\n“Money will always be important. But it is not just money alone … At the highest level, what are our strategic objectives? We want a well-informed population. We want a united people and we want a deeply engaged citizenship, who knows Singapore interests and Singaporean values” he said.\\n\\n“So as SPH media, we must think it through and think about how can we help contribute to this higher objective … And from there, I think we can translate into what are suitable metrics that our newsroom can contribute,” he said.\\n\\nMr Khaw added that he was confident in SPH titles’ abilities to grow their reach overseas.\\n\\nThis would be key in the business’ success, given that Singapore only has a small domestic market with 1.2 million households.\\n\\nEven if these were all paid subscribers, it would not be enough to make the business financially sustainable, Mr Khaw said.\\n\\nHe gave the example of The New York Times, which had to grow its subscriber base from one million to seven million, before it could “look at the possibility of making profits annually”.\\n\\nTHE NEED FOR PAYWALLS\\n\\nWhen asked about plans to continue with subscription models for SPH titles, Mr Khaw said he has “strong views” about pricing, calling it both “a science and an art”.\\n\\n“If your objective is to chase eyeballs, the easiest is to make it free,” he said.\\n\\nBut if the objective is to produce quality journalism, requiring paid subscriptions would help the newsroom by putting pressure on it to create content that customers find value in, Mr Khaw said.\\n\\n“If you insist on paid (subscriptions), and your product is ordinary … without much analysis or insight, why should people pay?\\n\\n“This paid model forces us to make sure you are a lot more analytical and more importantly, (providing) original insights which I can’t get from the competition.”\\n\\n“I’M NOT A JOURNALIST”: KHAW\\n\\nMr Khaw was also asked about his concerns about taking on an industry that he has no experience in.\\n\\nHe retired ahead of the General Election in July last year, after helming the Health Ministry, Transport Ministry and National Development Ministry over the course of his political career.\\n\\n“My big worry was what can I do to help you all? My coming here is to help SPH Media, but if I cannot make a difference, then it’s a waste of time, or a missed opportunity, as someone put it,\" Mr Khaw said.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know how to be a journalist and I am not a journalist. I\\'m out of my depth here. And therefore, how can I interfere in the newsroom?”\\n\\nHe added, however, that he knows what value-add he brings to the table.\\n\\n“My main contribution, I hope, is a significant one, which is: If I can help you reflect, reconstruct your products, to help us realise bigger potential and make the SPH Media brand even better, why not?”\\n\\n',\n",

No hugging and seeking forgiveness from one another. No posing for family photos in matching attire.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAmer Amat and Rahmah Zainolabidin are Singapore citizens who have been living in Johor Bahru for most of their lives. When the movement control order (MCO) was first declared in March 2020, they decided to stay on as they could not move all their belongings in time.\\n\\nMoreover, Amer, who had just suffered a stroke, was in no condition to travel.\\n\\nIman Nurhannah, 22, was in the first year of a business and management course at the Institute of Technical Education in Singapore. She dropped everything and went over to Johor to care for her grandparents.\\n\\n“I moved over because I was worried how grandma and grandfather will cope. My mother and siblings all had other obligations, and I felt that it was easiest for me to go,” said Iman Nurhannah when interviewed by CNA.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“I was putting my career and dreams on hold. But I felt (caring for my grandparents) was important too,” she added.\\n\\nBefore the pandemic, she would only visit during the weekends, when she had no classes. Now, she is the pillar of the household.\\n\\n“I’m thankful for what she has done,” said Rahmah. \"I know that deep down she wants to go home, but her mother won’t allow it because she wants her to take care of us,” said Rahmah.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nCHALLENGES IN HEALTHCARE, EXPENSES AS BORDER STAYS SHUT\\n\\nThe past 14 months has been a trying time for the trio.\\n\\n“We try not to go out if we can help it. Unless it\\'s for groceries or medicine for grandpa, we don’t leave the house ... We are here hanging on, hoping to stay safe and healthy,” said Iman Nurhannah.\\n\\nRahmah recalled the day when her husband was hit by a sudden stroke when he was sleeping at his home in Skudai. “He was taking a nap on his bed and he suddenly fell off the side. He called for me but when I came, he was no longer able to raise his hand or move his limbs. This was later diagnosed as a mild stroke by the general practitioner doctor we visited.”\\n\\nAmer has treatment once a week. “A physiotherapist would come and work with him. But if we don’t have enough money, we will ask the physio to come once a month instead,” said Iman Nurhannah.\\n\\nRahmah explained that as all three of them were not working, they are dependent on her daughter (Iman Nurhannah’s mother) and a younger son to support them. Both are working in Singapore.\\n\\n“They give us some money to pay our rent and utilities, but we don’t want to overburden them too much,” said Rahmah.\\n\\nIdeally, the family would like to return to Singapore. “Once we are in Singapore, we can seek treatment and financial help from the government agencies because we are citizens,” Iman Nurulhannah noted.\\n\\nWhile there are legal provisions for them to return to Singapore via the land checkpoints, they are unable to afford the ambulance costs needed to transport Amer across the Causeway as well as quarantine costs for all three of them.\\n\\nThe night before Hari Raya, Rahmah Zainolabidin and her children as well as grandchildren would usually hang out at this open space outside their condominium unit. (Photo: Amir Yusof)\\n\\nIman Nurulhannah said: “For us to head back, it will cost around S$2,000 to charter a private ambulance for us to go across the Causeway. Then there are also quarantine costs.\"\\n\\n\"Now with the 21-day quarantine imposed for those coming from Malaysia, it could cost us up to S$3,000 per person. That’s more than S$10,000 for just one trip, we simply cannot afford it.”\\n\\nGiven the costs involved, they have decided to stay put for now. But the situation is complicated by their immigration status.\\n\\nLast month, Malaysia said those who were holding expired social visit passes and stranded due to the MCO were required to leave the country by Apr 21 or risk being penalised.\\n\\nHowever, Malaysia\\'s Immigration Department director-general Khairul Dzaimee Daud said foreigners who were unable to leave the country by Apr 21 may apply for a special pass to extend their stay.\\n\\nThe three of them have appealed to extend their social visit passes with Malaysia’s Immigration Department but they have been unsuccessful so far.\\n\\n“We appealed on the basis of a doctor’s letter saying that my grandfather is not fit to travel, in the hope that the immigration authorities can show some compassion and grant us an extension,” said Iman Nurulhannah.\\n\\n“A SAD AND QUIET HARI RAYA”\\n\\nRahmah said for the festival later this week, the trio would just “sit at home quietly”.\\n\\n“Every (Hari) Raya, it’s a tradition for all of us, my siblings and my mother, to come here for our last breaking fast during Ramadan. Then we would welcome Hari Raya together, cook festive food and just celebrate the occasion. But this year, it will be a sad and quiet Hari Raya because it’s just us three.”\\n\\nShe added: “We won’t even cook the usual Hari Raya dishes because it’ll be wasting food. What’s worse, Amer’s condition is such that he can’t even walk and eat solid food, so we are in no mood to be festive.”\\n\\nRahmah Zainolabidin is grateful for the sacrifices her granddaughter have made to stay in Johor Bahru. (Photo: Amir Yusof)\\n\\nDespite the subdued mood, both granddaughter and grandmother said they are blessed.\\n\\n“Hari Raya is about family. The situation this year is far from ideal, but it serves as a reminder to be grateful that the three of us are here together, supporting one another,” said Rahmah.\\n\\nLooking ahead, Iman Nurulhannah said that she would prefer to return to Singapore to resume her studies and work to help her family financially.\\n\\n“My plan is to go back to Singapore, work full time and when I have enough, around S$8,000, enrol into a diploma course on food and beverage supervision at the Singapore Hotel and Tourism Education Centre (SHATEC),” she said.\\n\\n“I’m praying that the border reopens so my mother and I can straddle between working and taking care of grandma and grandpa,” she added.\\n\\n',\n",

His wife told the court that Mr Goh had picked her up from work on Jul 17, 2019.\\n\\nAfter telling her that the power to his Speedway-brand PMD had cut off, he began charging it in the living room next to his wife\\'s two PMDs.\\n\\nThe couple watched television, then closed the living room windows and went to bed just before midnight.\\n\\nAt about 12.30am on Jul 18, 2019, Mr Goh\\'s wife heard noises and woke her husband up thinking that there was someone in the living room.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHowever, when they opened the bedroom door, black smoke entered the room, she testified. She tried calling 995 twice, but the reception was bad.\\n\\nShe managed to confirm her address with the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) at 12.47am and they told her they were on their way.\\n\\nThe couple retreated into a walk-in closet connected to their master bedroom and opened the windows to get some air, but there was still a lot of smoke.\\n\\nThey used plush toys to cover their noses and headed towards the master bedroom toilet, but heard their two dogs barking from the living room.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMr Goh told his wife to go to the toilet and wait, before leaving to rescue their dogs. Shortly after, she heard her husband scream and tried to open the toilet door, but the handle was too hot to the touch.\\n\\nWhen the ceiling fixtures began to melt and fall on her, she climbed out of the toilet window and onto the air-conditioner ledge.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the couple\\'s neighbours gathered outside and tried to extinguish the fire using an internal hose reel from the lobby outside their flat.\\n\\nSCDF ARRIVED TO FIND MR GOH PASSED OUT\\n\\nFirefighters and police officers arrived at the flat on the 26th floor and forcibly entered the unit. They found Mr Goh collapsed on the floor in the common toilet, while his wife was on the aircon ledge outside. The two dogs were rescued.\\n\\nMr Goh and his wife were both taken to hospital. Mr Goh was assessed to be in cardiac arrest, with second-degree partial-thickness burns on about 40 per cent of his body. He died two days later on Jul 20, 2019.\\n\\nHis cause of death was certified as multi-organ failure following a heart attack with thermal burns and coronary artery disease.\\n\\nA fire investigation report by the SCDF showed that the fire had originated in the living room where the PMDs were placed. As the circuit breaker had tripped, there was likely to be an electrical anomaly that was caused either by the charging of the PMD, or the effects of the fire from the living room.\\n\\nRemnants of spent battery cells believed to be lithium-ion cells from the PMDs were recovered from the area where the fire originated.\\n\\nThe charging circuit was traced to the Speedway PMD, which had a two-pin plug inserted into a four-socket extension cord via a two-pin adapter. The extension cord was connected to the wall socket.\\n\\nOVERHEATING, LOOSENED CONTACTS FOUND\\n\\nLocalised resistance overheating with arching and melting was found at the two-pin plug and the charging port in the PMD, due to loosened contacts and a faulty charger.\\n\\nOverheating was also found in the battery packs of the Speedway PMD, due to an ineffective battery management system. The damage to the other two PMDs was secondary in nature, caused by the radiant heat flux from the fire outbreak which resulted in a thermal runaway in the two other PMDs, causing further heat damage in the living room.\\n\\nA technical report concluded that the fire was primarily caused by the overheating at the two-pin plug and charging port while the Speedway PMD was being charged.\\n\\nAn expert noted that the two-pin plug used in this case had flat pins and not cylindrical pins. He said the connection would not be good if a flat two-pin plug is connected to a socket that is not adapted for such a plug, as there may be a loose connection that could lead to overheating.\\n\\nHe gave the following recommendations: Charge PMDs or their batteries in a fully ventilated flat space and away from combustible materials; Do not leave charging devices unattended for an extended period of time or overnight; Maintain the PMDs in accordance with the manufacturer\\'s recommendation and promptly replace any faulty adapters or chargers; Regularly examine batteries for damage or deformities such as burns, punctures, bulging, cracks, corrosion or powdery residue; and buy and use only PMDs with the UL2272 certification mark; Do not modify PMDs.\\n\\nPolice investigations found that the couple had bought the Speedway PMD in 2016 and did not modify the battery pack. They had used the same battery pack since it was first purchased and did not buy an additional charger for it.\\n\\nPMD BOUGHT BEFORE STRICTER SAFETY REGULATIONS IMPOSED\\n\\nAccording to the coroner\\'s report, the PMD was designed in Korea and manufactured in China, and there were no compliance requirements or regulations set by the Land Transport Authority when it was marketed in Singapore.\\n\\nA manager of LTA\\'s active mobility group said that only UL2272 certified devices were allowed on cycling paths from Jul 1, 2020, a year after sale of non-UL2772 devices was banned.\\n\\nBetween 2017 and 2018, SCDF attended to 101 fires caused by non-UL2272 certified PMDs like the Speedway.\\n\\nThe UL2272 standard was announced in September 2018 and is a fire safety standard for motorised PMDs. However, even if a PMD has the certification, it does not mean it will not overheat or catch fire, and users should still adopt proper and safe handling of PMDs - such as not modifying their devices, not overcharging batteries and not leaving their devices unattended when charging.\\n\\nThe LTA manager added that users should avoid exposing their PMDs to water. If the device is exposed to wet weather conditions, it should be wiped dry immediately after use.\\n\\nThe coroner said there is no basis to suspect foul play, but said this \"tragic incident demonstrates the grave dangers of using the non-UL2272 certified PMDs\".\\n\\nShe advised owners of such devices to dispose of them, as they pose a significant fire risk, and conveyed her condolences to Mr Goh\\'s family for their very sad loss.',\n",

Hence, the actual declaration of an MCO should not have been unexpected.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nKelantan and two areas in Pahang were already under MCO, with a few areas in Kelantan under Enhanced MCO. Malaysians in other states exhaled a little, thinking they’d been spared.\\n\\nThe intention was to use targeted MCOs in response to rising numbers in specific locations. But the incremental declarations and lack of clarity only served to heighten uncertainty and exasperation.\\n\\nA medical worker collects a swab sample from a woman at a COVID-19 testing center in Kajang, outskirts of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, May 8, 2021. (Photo: AP/Vincent Thian)\\n\\nMr Ismail Sabri announced that Kuala Lumpur and three districts in Johor would be added to the MCO list barely a week ago. Swiftly after came the addition of Penang Island, a few more areas in Pahang and Perak, and an additional district in Johor.\\n\\nINCONSISTENCIES, U-TURNS AND CONFUSION\\n\\nInvalid email address It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive news updates and promotional material from Mediacorp and Mediacorp's partners.\\n\\nU-turns in the rules compounded public confusion as people struggled to keep track of what the latest changes were.\\n\\nIn this latest MCO, for example, the Ministry of Youth and Sports had earlier announced that individual exercise outside the home would not be allowed, a change from the last MCO. But the ban was retracted two days later after a public outcry.\\n\\nTake another example: Ramadan bazaars and night markets, initially allowed to proceed for ostensibly economic reasons, subject to local government rules, were ordered to be shut a few days later.\\n\\nOften, the trouble isn’t just the changing rules, but the short warning businesses, traders and the general public have. Many in F&B and retail have to scramble to clear stock, while households and small businesses have to stockpile to get through the lockdown period.\\n\\nMixed messaging from different ministries and ministers adds to the befuddlement.\\n\\nWhen Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation Khairy Jamaluddin, released a list of “potential cluster locations” identified by the national Hotspots Identification for Dynamic Engagement (HIDE) system as an early warning last Thursday, he stressed the move was geared towards enabling better individual decision-making.\\n\\nYet, on the same day, Mr Ismail Sabri then announced that these listed premises would be placed under immediate lockdown for three days. This had huge implications for many Malaysians as the list also included public transport hubs.\\n\\nIt often feels like the rules can change at no notice, and businesses and people have to be constantly alert for updates. No announcement can be taken at face value.\\n\\nFor example, while Mr Ismail Sabri said employees needed police permits to travel for work or health purposes as an exception to the ban on inter-district travel, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry Malaysia later clarified that an employment pass and employer’s letter would suffice.\\n\\nMalaysia Senior Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob. (File photo: Bernama)\\n\\nThe police also had to highlight that police permits were not necessary for medical appointments and COVID-19 vaccinations.\\n\\nMost of the anger is directed at the lack of holistic, carefully thought-through measures. Authorities fixate on numbers in each car but not the passengers in densely packed public transportation.\\n\\nWhile dining al fresco with safe distancing is not allowed, close-contact, high-density, closed-environment work in factories continue. This despite factory clusters being rife.\\n\\n\\n\\nNEW LEVELS OF FATIGUE AND FRUSTRATION\\n\\nAll around the world, long lockdowns and changing rules have left people with fatigue and frustration.\\n\\nThis is especially true in Malaysia, when daily-wage earners, small businesses and families have been financially battered with each lockdown.\\n\\nAll this is fueling a sense of hopelessness in escaping the pandemic and the accompanying hardships, with the spotlight turned on government rules.\\n\\nThe policy u-turns are not seen as a willingness on the government’s part to listen to public feedback, but instead are taken as a sign that many restrictions are knee-jerk reactions and guesswork than considered decisions based on science and data.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: Medical workers collect swab samples from people at a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) testing centre in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia January 25, 2021. REUTERS/Lim Huey Teng\\n\\nAt the same time, detailed and timely SOPs are lacking and enforcement is selective.\\n\\nSocial media is rife with posts criticising the government and its management of the pandemic. Many cite MCO-induced inconveniences, the negative impacts past MCOs have had on businesses and incomes, and the climbing trend of infection numbers.\\n\\nDENIAL, DOUBT AND DIVISIONS\\n\\nThe frustration with the government and its lack of clarity and consistency has serious consequences on citizens’ grasp of the dangers of COVID-19 and Malaysia’s recent spike in cases in some areas.\\n\\nCOVID-19 daily infection rates have soared above 4,000 several times in the past two weeks. The number of patients in ICU, intubated and dying are at record highs.\\n\\nYet, while some are calling for a return to the tight restrictions of MCO 1.0 to properly stem the rise in infections, not everyone believes that this is the solution.\\n\\nIn the rural outskirts, many yet untouched by the virus struggle to believe that it is dangerous. Most also do not understand how new variants of concern, now circulating in Malaysia, could pose new challenges for the country and necessitate a rapid response when numbers spike.\\n\\nNowhere is this clearer than in Kelantan, which saw a sudden spike in numbers leading to its early MCO. Prior to that, there were many instances of the SOPs being ignored, of people not wearing masks and regular large gatherings. Reports now indicate that the COVID-19 variant originating from South Africa has been found in infection cases there.\\n\\nMany Malaysians living in the rural outskirts receive news of the desperation in India by Whatsapp, yet struggle to believe that it could happen in their own neighbourhoods.\\n\\nI have also heard of people denying reported infection numbers and harbouring views that they know of people who were infected but were fine because it is “nothing more than the flu”.\\n\\nTHE REAL DANGER\\n\\nThe danger in Malaysia’s current situation is not the steady rise in infection numbers, but the increasing denial, doubt and divisions brewing on the ground.\\n\\nThe Malaysian government needs a unified communication strategy that focuses on the dangers of the virus, with a sole voice speaking with authority.\\n\\nThe Ministry of Health needs to create and disseminate accessible COVID-19 updates in local languages via Whatsapp and TikTok.\\n\\nMuslim wearing protective masks waiting for customer outside a scarf shop at a Ramadan bazaar, amid the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Monday, April 19, 2021. (Photo: AP/Vincent Thian)\\n\\nThey need to underscore the severity of the situation, of the struggles medical personnel undergo, that COVID-19 and ICU beds are full, and that the number of deaths are steadily increasing.\\n\\nBecause death rituals are so important to rural communities, these videos need to demonstrate how death by COVID-19 entails dying alone and being buried only by medical staff in PPEs. Perhaps this might motivate them to take the virus threat more seriously.\\n\\nThey also need to disseminate information on policy changes and details through similar social media channels.\\n\\nComplete enforcement is difficult given Malaysia’s size and sprawl. If Malaysia cannot keep such doubts and divisions under control to launch a unified national response, new daily infections breaching 5,000 may come sooner rather than later.\\n\\nDownload our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram\\n\\nDr Serina Rahman, Visiting Fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, writes from Johor where she’s in lockdown with the rest of Malaysia.\",\n",

Written below were: “Designation: Exo Planet” and “Location: Outer Orbit”.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nEXO also shared an exclusive behind-the-scenes video of their set on their upcoming single, also called Don’t Fight The Feeling.\\n\\nThere’s a bit of a narrative going on, of course – the album follows the sci-fi storyline of their 2017 hit Power, which they performed back in 2018 for the closing ceremony of Winter Olympics in South Korea.\\n\\nOne of the members, DO, shared: “The story is, in Power, we all went our separate ways. But we are now back together.” He and Xiumin have officially returned to the group after completion of mandatory military service.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDebuted in 2012, Exo has been active in the K-pop scene for nine years and comprises nine members. However, some of them are on hiatus and will not be featured in their upcoming album. It’s not confirmed which ones will be in the new album but it’s probably safe to assume the currently active ones – DO, Xiumin, Kai and Sehun – will be in it.\\n\\nFour others – including Baekhyun, who enlisted on May 6 – are currently serving the military, while Lay’s back in China pursuing a solo career at the moment.',\n",

              " \"Talking Point host Steven Chia puts his health on the line again, this time as he digs into Singapore’s love affair with fried chicken. Is there a healthier alternative?\\n\\nSINGAPORE: There have been several fried chicken trends in Singapore since the first fast-food fried chicken chain, KFC, opened in 1977.\\n\\nThere was ayam penyet (Indonesian smashed fried chicken) from around 2007, Korean fried chicken from around 2010 and gourmet fried chicken from around 2017, said food writer Annette Tan. The result is a “nice variety of fried chicken” available.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nEateries specialising in fried chicken that have opened in recent years include Birdfolks and Arnold’s. It is also among the top orders on food delivery platforms foodpanda and GrabFood. These days, one can even have it with ice cream.\\n\\nSo it sounded like a foodie’s dream assignment to tuck into fried chicken daily for a fortnight. After a similar experiment with bubble tea, Talking Point host Steven Chia took up this challenge befitting Colonel Harland Sanders himself.\\n\\nBesides KFC, Korean fried chicken is popular in Singapore.\\n\\nAlong the way, he found out why fried chicken is irresistible to Singaporeans, the health effects of bingeing on the dish, and ways to make it more palatable to consumers watching their cholesterol and waistlines.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nINVADING THE SENSES\\n\\nEating fried chicken is a sensory experience, said chef Sameer Chablani, who was a cashier and one of the kitchen staff members at KFC when he was only 14 years old.\\n\\nThere is the smell that entices customers before they enter the outlets, as well as the sight and sound of others biting into the batter. “Before you even get to the taste … your mind’s been made up,” he said.\\n\\nEffective marketing, such as the launch of limited edition flavours, also keeps customers coming back. According to Chiara Ang, a senior writer and host at food site EatBook, audio marketing is an “up-and-coming” tactic.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAn audiovisual treat: A person eating a large quantity of food on video while addressing an audience.\\n\\nBrands may engage “mukbangers” — people who consume large amounts of food while interacting with online audiences — to eat platters of fried chicken.\\n\\nTheir videos are not complete without that crunch of teeth sinking into the chicken as the vloggers move closer to the microphone.\\n\\nFor his part, Chia initially felt himself getting hooked on fried chicken. But the passion wore off by the latter half of his experiment.\\n\\nThe grease made him feel tired, and his physician, Philip Koh of Healthway Medical (Tampines), found that his cholesterol levels had gone up 5 to 6 per cent by the end of the fortnight.\\n\\nLove CNA Insider videos and stories?

(8:10)\\n\\nBad cholesterol can clog up the arteries and increase the risk of a heart attack or stroke. If Chia should continue on this diet for months or longer, he would be a contender for premature heart attack.\\n\\nEating fried chicken daily is “definitely too much”, said Koh, who added that one must also eat fruits and vegetables and exercise. He had given the green light for the two-week challenge only because of Chia’s low cardiovascular risk.\\n\\nHEALTHIER BUT LESS AFFORDABLE\\n\\nSo what is in the fried chicken from the food chains? With the help of a laboratory, Talking Point tested various brands of American-, Korean- and Taiwanese-style fried chicken for monosodium glutamate (MSG), sodium and fat.\\n\\nIt found American-style chicken to be lower in all three components, while Taiwanese-style chicken came top in MSG and sodium content.\\n\\nWATCH: The first episode in full — Our love for fried chicken: What makes it so irresistible? (23:48)\\n\\nPaired with fries, mashed potatoes and ketchup, a fried chicken meal could “easily” exceed half of one’s recommended maximum sodium intake of 2,000 milligrammes a day, said National University of Singapore senior lecturer in food science and technology Leong Lai Peng.\\n\\nToo much sodium can lead to high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke.\\n\\nIf people are unable to give up fried chicken entirely, there are ways to make it less unhealthy. They could use oil that contains more monounsaturated fat, such as extra light olive oil and canola oil, said Raffles Medical Group principal dietitian Bibi Chia.\\n\\nThe frying temperature should typically range between 160 and 190 degrees Celsius, as the meat absorbs more oil at lower temperatures. Consumers should ensure also that their chicken’s internal temperature is 80 degrees Celsius, so that the meat is cooked properly.\\n\\nThere are ways to make fried chicken less unhealthy.\\n\\nA thinner batter would absorb less oil, the dietitian added.\\n\\nWith chef Chablani’s help, Chia came up with a recipe that had less salt, more herbs and spices and significantly less oil using an air fryer.\\n\\nBut such a method would jack up the cost of a two-piece chicken meal to about S$15, double the price at a fast-food chain.\\n\\nThis is due to economies of scale — the air fryer can produce only “three to four pieces” every 15 to 20 minutes, and it is impossible to cook “too far in advance”, Chablani said.\\n\\nAt a tasting event that marked the finale to Chia’s fried chicken odyssey, 16 guests tried the healthier recipe, but only five said they would be willing to pay S$15 for his dish.\\n\\nWATCH: The second episode in full — For the love of fried chicken: Can it be healthier? (22:13)\\n\\n“I guess it’s hard to give up the inexpensive, accessible and tasty fried chicken as we know it,” he concluded.\\n\\n“But in the long run, it would actually be better for our health. So if more of us do show an interest … we just might see more healthier and affordable options available.”\\n\\nWatch these two episodes of Talking Point here and here.

The programme Undercover Asia speaks to victims, experts and an ex-abuser about the deep-seated problem.\\n\\nBEIJING: After enduring six years of attacks, Shaanxi native Yang Xi killed her husband.\\n\\nLife with him had been “worse than hell”, but the last straw was when he came up to her with a rope and axe. He threatened to slaughter her family, including her child, if she did not kill herself.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“All those years, he’d often threaten (me) and then make good on those threats,” the 41-year-old recounted. “In that instance, all the grievances accumulated over six years — including him beating my mother and child — finally erupted.”\\n\\nThat night, she picked up the axe and killed him. “I didn’t expect myself to have the guts to do such a thing,” she said.\\n\\n“Afterwards I was frightened, yet relieved to know that no one would beat me, my mother, my father and my child any more.”\\n\\nYang Xi's second husband abused her, her child and her mother.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIt was not her first abusive relationship. When she was 17, her fiancé became violent after she asked to delay their wedding. According to her mother, he was of “inferior” character and afraid Yang would change her mind.\\n\\nOver two years, their relationship soured. One day, he pushed her down when they were arguing and gouged her eyes out with his hands. He was sentenced to death, according to her.\\n\\nFeeling like she could not survive as a blind, unmarried woman in a poor rural area, she got married twice — the second time to the man who beat and threatened her.\\n\\nShe was sentenced to 12 years in jail for killing him and released after eight years. In jail, where she learnt how to be a masseuse, Yang said she met female inmates who had been similarly abused.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nYang Xi got married as she felt that a blind, unmarried woman couldn't survive in a poor rural area.\\n\\nAbout one in four women in China are said to have experienced domestic violence. Every 7.4 seconds, another woman falls victim to this deeply entrenched problem, according to the All-China Women's Federation, the country’s largest women’s organisation.\\n\\nCan the world’s most populous nation stem the scourge, asks the programme Undercover Asia.\\n\\n‘PATRIARCHAL POWER’\\n\\nChina remains a traditional society that prizes harmony in the household, arising from Confucian patriarchy.\\n\\nLove CNA Insider videos and stories?

Lamu’s death, after she suffered 90 per cent burns, stoked a public outcry.\\n\\nAlthough a higher proportion of victims are in rural areas, domestic violence is very much present in cities. Abusers may, however, be more “secretive” in order to keep up a “glamorous” front to neighbours and colleagues, said Ma.\\n\\nDomestic violence is also a problem in metropolitan cities in China.\\n\\nShanghai resident Wei La (not her real name), a successful entrepreneur, told Undercover Asia how a “sensitive soul” she met in 2019 quickly became a manipulative man.\\n\\nOne night when she was a few minutes late arriving at his place, his suspicions about her whereabouts turned violent. He rained punches on her head, kicked her stomach and sat on her.\\n\\n“I felt like I was going to die,” she said.\\n\\nWhen she seized a window of opportunity to run out of the house, he chased her and yanked her out of a taxi. She managed to get to a friend’s place only after a couple passing by stopped to help.\\n\\nHe harassed her and threatened to harm her family and make a scene at her company. “My friend asked me why I didn’t leave him, and I had nothing to say,” she said.\\n\\n“It’s not that I didn’t want to leave him, but he’s like a piece of chewing gum. Even after you tear it off, there are remnants.”\\n\\nDomestic violence victim Wei La (pseudonym) is a successful entrepreneur.\\n\\nGAPS IN THE LAW\\n\\nThe authorities have taken steps in recent years to address domestic violence, but activists say gaps persist. They also highlight the role men play in ensuring that harmful norms and notions do not get passed to future generations.\\n\\nAbout 157,000 Chinese women commit suicide per year, and in a 2016 study by the All-China Women’s Federation, 60 per cent of the cases were related family violence.\\n\\nThat year, the government introduced a domestic violence law that allows victims to obtain protection orders against their abusers.\\n\\nState media reported that complaints about domestic violence made to the women’s federation decreased by 8.4 per cent in 2019 compared to 2018. But observers say this is not the full picture.\\n\\nChina enacted its first national law against domestic violence in 2016.\\n\\n“When grievous harm is inflicted, the judge still takes into account family conflict as a mitigating factor for a lighter sentence,” cited Ma, who feels that the law does not go far enough.\\n\\n“It’s hard to understand. If you hit someone in the street, you may face jail time of three to seven years. However, for violence in a family setting, one might get only three years, with it hardly ever going to seven years.”\\n\\nSome police officers are insufficiently trained to deal with domestic violence; for instance, they may tell victims their injuries are “too minor”, said Lin.\\n\\nAccording to her, victims must do “a lot of work” after going to the police, such as collecting evidence and documenting their injuries.\\n\\nWATCH: China's struggle with domestic violence — A potent patriarchy (46:12)\\n\\nMore victims are now willing to dial the police hotline, and the law requires that all calls be accepted, noted Feng Yuan, co-founder of Equality, a women’s rights and gender equality non-governmental organisation in Beijing.\\n\\n“But what’s the problem now? (It’s that) calls aren’t taken properly. When the police hear that it’s a family matter, they’d just give you some casual advice,” she said.\\n\\n“Or even when they hear that it’s domestic violence, they just dismiss it as a family matter and don’t deal with it properly.”\\n\\nAN EX-ABUSER’S STORY\\n\\nAs part of efforts to reduce domestic violence against women, the China White Ribbon Volunteers Network — launched in 2013 by sexologist Fang Gang — counsels abusers.\\n\\nThe China White Ribbon Volunteers Network educates men on their gender roles and to respect women.\\n\\nOne of its volunteers, Gu Wei, used to beat his wife so badly — with fist clenched “like an iron hammer” — over four years that she filed for divorce.\\n\\nWhile searching online for information on claiming child custody, he chanced upon a television documentary about domestic violence that, incidentally, featured Yang.\\n\\nHe felt “miserable” after watching the women recount their experiences. He called a hotline number provided and spoke to a psychologist trained to work with abusers. He realised he had learnt violence from his father and other male relatives.\\n\\nHis parents also saw him mistreating his wife but sided with him. Today, he is “worried” his son will pick up violent behaviour from him.\\n\\nGu Wei abused his wife and is now an anti-domestic violence advocate.\\n\\nNow divorced, he has explained to his son that he had hurt the boy’s mother, so she had to leave “to protect herself”. He tells the nine-year-old that they should respect her, and lets him visit her.\\n\\nIn 2018, the ex-abuser performed in a play called The Penis Monologues, inspired by American playwright Eve Ensler’s The Vagina Monologues. Written by Fang, it explores masculinity issues including domestic violence.\\n\\nIn it, Gu shared that he had asked his ex-wife for five years to prove that he has given up his abusive ways. “I want these violent practices to stop in my generation,” he said.\\n\\nWatch this episode of Undercover Asia here.

Within a month, she raised S$2,045 for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA).\\n\\nNot the best-performing campaign, Anthony admits, but the seed had been planted.\\n\\nTwo days after she started her first campaign, she launched another. Owing to the pandemic, her school had discontinued a programme giving biscuits to hungry children during recess, so she decided to raise funds for “little P1 and P2 children”.\\n\\nThe online campaign ran from June to December.\\n\\nThis campaign has been her most successful yet, raising more than S$56,000 for recess money.\\n\\nWHAT’S HER SECRET?\\n\\nOver the months, Rui Jie has run campaigns for organisations like the SPCA and others including Care Singapore. Her father often helps her to shortlist charities she could help, telling her about the work they do.\\n\\nAnimals (especially rabbits) are a favourite of hers. So are children, but she is careful to say, children who are younger than her.\\n\\n“Because when I help them, they won’t say, thank you mei mei (little sister), but thank you jie jie (older sister),” she explains, eliciting a laugh from her parents. “It feels like I’m older than them, and it feels good.”\\n\\nRui Jie with her mum, Joan, and dad Anthony.\\n\\nShe is an only child and the youngest in her extended family, so her parents do know that being called jie jie means a lot to her.\\n\\nIn her campaigns, says Anthony, she is the “director” who designs the graphics and writes the posts, while he helps her to post her work on the fund-raising platform. “Basically she makes the decision, and I’m the minion,” he jokes.\\n\\nNone of them expected that she would go on to raise S$250,000.\\n\\n“I didn’t think it was a lot of money at first,” she says. “When my friends saw me, they said their parents told them it was a lot of money, and that was when I started feeling proud of myself.”\\n\\nWATCH: How a 10-year-old raised $250,000 online for charity (3:22)\\n\\nBesides the money she has raised online, Anthony says there have been times when her campaigns translated into offline donations.\\n\\n“Some corporate donors called me and said … hey, I saw this campaign that’s raising money for your charity, and I want to support,” he recounts.\\n\\nYet neither she nor her parents have shared her campaigns with their friends or on social media, he adds. They have no idea who has contributed. Why, then, has she managed to touch many people’s hearts?\\n\\nPerhaps, Anthony suggests, her campaigns capture people’s attention because they are worded simply.\\n\\nSome of Rui Jie's past campaigns.\\n\\nFor example, he recalls both of them discussing how to word the School Pocket Money Fund campaign and eventually settling on “For the little P1 and P2 recess money”.\\n\\n“It’s simple and succinct. And people would be able to … appreciate what we’re doing,” he cites.\\n\\n(And because Rui Jie wanted to help children younger than her, the campaign was updated to include Primary Three pupils when she entered Primary Four.)\\n\\nHer mother thinks the authenticity of her voice could also have played a part. “As a young girl, the way she phrases stories can be different in terms of the visuals and images that she selects,” says Joan Sim.\\n\\nIndeed, these are reasons why Caroline Lim, the head of the Singapore University of Social Sciences’ Organisation and Leadership for Non-Profits Programme, thinks Rui Jie’s campaigns stand out.\\n\\nCampaign page updated to include Primary Three beneficiaries.\\n\\n“We know that donors give because they’re moved by their hearts and less by their heads, especially when it comes to micro-contributions,” she says. “Her simple, short story tugs at people’s heartstrings.”\\n\\nAnother important element is that donors “see the image” in their minds. This is how Rui Jie’s pink animated graphic worked in a big way, cites Caroline.\\n\\n“In those very simple few seconds, I could see the rabbit going hungry,” says the researcher. “You must be able to tell a story that can imprint an image in the minds of their donors and get them to act.”\\n\\nINCREASED COMPETITION FOR ONLINE DONORS\\n\\nRui Jie’s efforts also stand out against a backdrop of an increasing number of campaigns going online as the COVID-19 pandemic halted physical fundraisers.\\n\\nStandout campaigner.\\n\\nOnline platforms Giving.sg and Give.asia both told CNA Insider they saw a sharp increase in the amount of money raised in the past financial year.\\n\\nGiving.sg hit S$102 million in donations in the period from April last year to this March — the largest amount donated in its history.\\n\\nIt saw a 158 per cent increase in donations from the previous year and a 140 per cent increase in the number of campaigns, says Tony Soh, deputy chief executive officer of the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre, which runs the platform.\\n\\nAt Give.asia, the past year’s donations were two times higher overall, with some standout months, says co-founder Pong Yu Ming. Donations in April last year, for example, stood at S$4 million, compared to the S$1 million raised in April 2019.\\n\\nA screen shot from the Give.asia website, an online fund-raising platform.\\n\\nThe pandemic has helped to drive online donations, with Tony noting that the circuit breaker accelerated the adoption of digital technology in daily life. “The public felt more comfortable, I think, transacting and eventually also donating online,” he says.\\n\\nAccording to Give.asia, a campaign that includes a video is 10 times more likely to reach S$100,000 in donations. One that includes a story of more than 100 words is also 10 times more likely to do well.\\n\\nA campaign organiser who updates donors regularly is four times more likely to encounter repeat donors.\\n\\nTony says topics that are at the forefront of people’s minds can also draw more responses. For example, a campaign to help victims of the 2019 accident at Lucky Plaza raised more than S$360,000 in seven days.\\n\\nPeople came, and a memorial site was laid out for the victims of the Lucky Plaza accident. (Photo: Cindy Co)\\n\\n“When there’s an outpouring of public emotions, outrage and support, when there’s a campaign that’ll channel funds to the victims, that can activate a lot of giving,” he says.\\n\\nCaroline notes that charities hoping to move their fund-raising online, however, must make some adjustments. For one thing, the profile of online donors is different from people who usually donate at physical fundraisers, such as a gala dinner or marathon.\\n\\n“(Online donors) may give small amounts, but they give on a regular basis and they give quite frequently,” she says.\\n\\nMessaging is also important for standing out in the increasingly crowded online scene.\\n\\n“It’s about crafting that message that can stir emotion, relate to your target donors and compel them to donate,” she says. “Most importantly, because we’re talking about the online platform, we want them to share (the campaign).\\n\\n“We can’t run away from that — things can spread so fast. You just need a few people to share, and suddenly … there’s the exponential impact.”\\n\\nA screen shot from the Giving.sg platform for people to donate, volunteer or raise funds.\\n\\nA cause that has a universal appeal could mean donations pouring in from all over the world. “The market for charitable giving is infinite. When charities move online, they’re widening the pool of donors, supporters and advocates,” she says.\\n\\nUltimately, Tony notes, it is important to try. The varying degrees of success of Rui Jie’s different campaigns indicates that “there’s no magic formula” for what works.\\n\\n“There’s no need to … figure out the formula,” he says. “Make the best effort, share it with your friends, and if it’s something that triggers people’s emotions, I think that’s going to be successful.\\n\\n“There are good practices and learning points. But the best thing about it is, if you feel something about it, just give it a try.”\\n\\nMr Tony Soh. (Photo: National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre)\\n\\nTHEY WANT HER TO KEEP GOING\\n\\nThe importance of giving back and helping others is something Rui Jie’s parents have taught her since young.\\n\\nIn his past role as the Singapore Symphony Orchestra’s head fundraiser, Anthony took her to charity concerts and let her mingle with young beneficiaries.\\n\\n“You have food, you get to go to classes, you don’t have to worry about having no Internet or no money,” he reminds her. “What if you have no laptop? Even if you’re talented, how are you going to (raise funds)?\\n\\nSo she gets the sense that not everyone is as lucky as her.\\n\\nHis lessons do not seem to be lost on her. She is, for example, proud to have helped other pupils — “little friends”, in her words — with their homework in the student care centre she attends.\\n\\nBorn in the Year of the Rabbit, Rui Jie can't get enough of younger pupils calling her jie jie.\\n\\nTo her, the six-figure sum she has raised is just a number, an amount she would save for retirement if it was in her bank account, she says in all seriousness.\\n\\nWhat has excited her more are the photographs of rabbits and the certificates of appreciation she has received from the charities she has raised funds for, all of them saved in a folder.\\n\\nIn addition, Frasers Hospitality chose her as a Kindness Hero for its Remembering Kindness global campaign, which encouraged people to share stories of individuals who have helped others in need. She was the youngest winner and participant worldwide.\\n\\nAnthony says that collecting the certificates and recognising her achievements with nominations such as this are intentional. “I don’t try to impress on her the amount (she’s raised),” he says. “I’m more concerned with getting her to continue.\\n\\n“Sometimes you stare at the screen and ask yourself if anyone cares that I’m doing this … or are they getting so much help they don’t actually need me?\\n\\n“I want to give her the sense that she has a voice … that what she does is important and she can ask others to do it as well.”\",\n",

For one thing, its military, the Tentara Nasional Indonesia (TNI), has fashioned a new role for itself.\\n\\n“I can’t see the TNI attempting to engage in the same sort of activities as we’ve seen in Myanmar or Thailand, principally because I think the mindset of the TNI officer is changing,” said the associate professor.\\n\\n“There’s a desire to be more professional.”\\n\\nThe more important reason why he believes a coup in Indonesia is unlikely is that “we live in a different age now”.\\n\\nWATCH: Indonesia military (TNI) — Why it’s not getting involved in politics again (3:10)\\n\\n“Social media is so prevalent in Indonesia with the use of Facebook and Twitter. A TNI soldier can’t engage in any human rights violation without it being captured on YouTube or any of these media,” he said.\\n\\nAnd of course, Indonesia’s civil society and media have a tremendous role to play.\\n\\nHIJACKED FOR POLITICAL INTERESTS\\n\\nSuharto’s 32-year reign was a period of stability and economic growth for Indonesia. But scholars note that he first hijacked the military for his political interests and embarked on a nationwide purge of suspected communists and their sympathisers.\\n\\nThe death toll of the anti-communist campaign is disputed even today. Human Rights Watch’s Indonesia researcher Andreas Harsono said the numbers range between 500,000 and three million.\\n\\nBedjo is still seeking justice for victims of the purge as one of the founders of the 1965 Murder Victims Research Foundation.\\n\\nBedjo Untung was arrested in 1970 while working in a department store.\\n\\n“Apparently, I was arrested for being a member of the Indonesian Students’ Youth Association, which was deemed pro-PKI (Indonesian Communist Party). We became scapegoats. What happened to us didn’t make any sense,” he said.\\n\\n“We became the victims of a power struggle, and we paid the price for it. We were innocent.”\\n\\nRSIS visiting fellow Noor Huda Ismail said Suharto used the military’s might “for his own purposes”, for instance to annex East Timor. “No doubt he also asked the military to do things that might harm its own people,” he said.\\n\\n“We (saw) a number of human rights abuses, either in Aceh, Papua, East Timor, also against the so-called ‘kelompok kanan’, the (threat from right-wing) Islamist groups.”\\n\\nThe Indonesian military committed human rights abuses during the Suharto era.\\n\\nSuharto stepped down amid major riots in the wake of the Asian financial crisis, during which the rupiah lost much of its value against the United States dollar, unemployment rose and prices of basic goods and inflation soared.\\n\\nAnd the public does not wish for a return to the old regime or to see the military “involved in politics again”, said Made Supriatma, a visiting fellow at Singapore’s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.\\n\\n“What people want to see is a professional military … capable of handling the security threat, especially the threat that’s coming from outside the country.”\\n\\n‘RESPECT DEMOCRACY’\\n\\nAlthough the military can no longer be involved in Indonesian politics by law and is subservient to the civilian leadership, retired generals do hold political appointments.\\n\\nMr Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan is a retired general and Indonesian politician.\\n\\nFormer leader Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who was president from 2004 to 2014, was a general. In the current Cabinet, there is Defence Minister Prabowo Subianto and Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan.\\n\\nMany political parties in Indonesia look to the military as a “source of leadership”, noted Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a research professor at the Indonesian Institute of Sciences’ Centre for Political Studies.\\n\\nFormer officers and generals have been tapped for their experience in management, leadership qualities and the fact that many of them “were already well known”.\\n\\n“A lot of these Islamic political parties, secular political parties … courted different senior officers,” she said.\\n\\n“So it’s not surprising if you look at the Cabinet of (President) Joko Widodo — maybe because he’s a civilian and feels the need to have some strong guys.”\\n\\nWATCH: The full episode — Military in politics: Indonesia (48:07)\\n\\nIndonesia’s military has regained its credibility, with public surveys showing it to be one of the country’s most trusted institutions, ahead of even the president.\\n\\nIt is one reason that retired generals can become ministers if appointed by the president, or can become the next president if elected by the people, said Coordinating Minister Luhut, 73.\\n\\nHe thinks Indonesia is “more mature” than it was before 1998. “The TNI understand that we should respect democracy … and protect our own democracy,” he added. “That’s the democracy that we love today.”\\n\\nWatch this episode of Insight here.

              " \"The market for health and beauty products in the country is soaring. But there have also been concerns about bogus and misleading claims, so how safe and effective are these supplements? The programme Undercover Asia investigates.\\n\\nKUALA LUMPUR: When Fauzi (not his real name) faced a weight problem due to irregular eating and sleeping habits, he turned to Choco Fit, a chocolate slimming drink he found online.\\n\\n“Because these products had been endorsed by (Malaysian) celebrities, I was attracted to them,” he said. “I thought they were suitable for me because I don’t exercise.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nFauzi, who weighed 90 kilogrammes, lost 5 to 6 kg within three months.\\n\\n“I was like, ‘Wow.’ In the morning, I’d eat roti prata or nasi lemak. After eating, I’d drink the (slimming product). It’d last me until dinner — I’d just drink water,” he recounted.\\n\\n“The celebrity (who marketed the product) asked me to take pictures. She wanted me to take ‘before and after’ photos of myself after one month, for her to share on her Instagram.”\\n\\nFull-time home baker Azie, 31, is another who turned to a dietary supplement she found online, one that promised weight loss within three days. When she initially felt nauseous, the seller advised her to reduce her intake of the drink.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“I still experienced discomfort, such as headaches and nausea. So I stopped taking it,” said Azie, who eventually found another product that worked for her.\\n\\nThe weight-loss photos she shared on Facebook led “a lot of people” to ask how she had achieved it, which in turn got her persuading them to try the product. She eventually became a sales agent, or drop-ship retailer.\\n\\nAzie showing a photo of herself after she lost weight.\\n\\nWith more than 80 per cent of Malaysia’s population tapping into the internet, Azie and Fauzi are among a growing number who are buying vitamin and dietary supplements online.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAnd the marketing boom on social media has contributed to the growth of a multimillion dollar market for these products. Sales reached RM3.1 billion (S$1 billion) in 2019 — up by 50 per cent in five years — according to Euromonitor.\\n\\nBut amid the e-commerce tactics are some misleading and exaggerated claims, including about being able to cure COVID-19. The continued use of online products also led to vastly different results for Azie and Fauzi.\\n\\nThe programme Undercover Asia explores the true picture behind this marketing phenomenon and whether there is a hidden price to pay for these products.\\n\\nA multimillion dollar business.\\n\\nENTERTAINING, TACKY, MISLEADING?\\n\\nLove CNA Insider videos and stories?

By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive news updates and promotional material from Mediacorp and Mediacorp's partners.\\n\\nOne of the well-known names in Malaysia’s health and food supplements industry is entrepreneur and social media influencer Aliff Syukri Kamarzaman, the 34-year-old founder of D’Herbs Holdings.\\n\\nHe presides over more than 30 direct employees who help him manage a network of over 20,000 sales agents. In the past three years, his Instagram following has grown to 4.3 million subscribers.\\n\\nHe also has a lavish home and lifestyle, which he shows on his TV Terlajak Laris YouTube channel, with 1.47 million subscribers.\\n\\nHis social media following and extensive online channels have boosted his business since its founding in 2010. His personal brand has grown to more than 100 products, and by his own account, his sales topped RM70 million in 2019.\\n\\nAnother influencer is Hasmiza Othman, better known by the moniker of Dato Vida. Like Aliff, she is her own boss and has a line of health products as well as a penchant for self-promotion and displays of material wealth.\\n\\nHasmiza Othman, also known as Dato Vida, in a promotional video.\\n\\nEntertainment value explains a large part of their popularity, said Nurzihan Hassim, a senior lecturer in media and communication at Taylor’s University, Malaysia.\\n\\n“(They) are larger than life … They flaunt their riches (and) outfits,” she noted. “So when you come back to the idea of social comparison … you look at that influencer and you’re like, ‘Oh, I wish I could be like him.’\\n\\n“A lot people have this upwards comparison … so they’d want to believe what the influencer says is true.”\\n\\nAlthough Aliff’s and Hasmiza’s videos and content often “look tacky”, and they may talk in ways that “intentionally provoke the audience”, said influencer marketing expert Yuh Wen Foong, their fans and netizens come back for more.\\n\\n“They remember (the content) … It’s a very good recall for the brain.”\\n\\nAliff Syukri Kamarzaman showing the interior of his home in a video.\\n\\nWhen asked, however, if his company overreaches itself in making promises, Aliff said: “If we don’t praise our own products and claim that they’re good, who would?\\n\\n“In 10 claims, we go overboard with one. We can’t possibly be too honest. We’re selling products.”\\n\\nIn 2017, D’Herbs Holdings was fined RM11,000 for its misleading advertisements for two products, which included the claim that its Jus Perawan (Virgin Juice) Gold could boost the immune system. Such an assertion contravenes Malaysia’s Food Act.\\n\\nThat same year, Hasmiza was fined RM4,800 under the Medicines (Advertisement and Sale) Act after she was convicted of unlawfully advertising her Pamoga health drink.\\n\\nThese products continue to be sold.\\n\\nAliff in his company's product showroom.\\n\\nSAFETY CALLED INTO QUESTION\\n\\nOver the years, general surgeon Ahmad Tarmizi Mohammad has had his fair share of patients who fell for the far-fetched claims of some health product sellers, especially patients with multiple or serious medical conditions.\\n\\n“You drink this and you’re cured of diabetes, hypertension, gout, cholesterol or even heart disease. And the most ridiculous is of course cancer,” he cited.\\n\\nI’ve been treating cancer patients … Most of the time when they’re diagnosed, they’re looking for a cure, in whatever stage they are.\\n\\nBut claims aside, the safety of these products has been called into question. Tarmizi said some so-called energy boosters contain steroids, which “can cause a lot of problems” if ingested in large amounts.\\n\\n“The worst-case scenario is it can cause (stomach) ulcers … (and) bleeding that can cause death,” he added.\\n\\nDr Ahmad Tarmizi Mohammad.\\n\\nFauzi, who was consuming Choco Fit, is one who suffered side effects including chronic headaches and gastric problems. The influencer who sold him the product advised him to continue taking it but stop whenever he had gastric problems.\\n\\nFauzi followed the advice, but he later had to go into hospital when he felt a “sharp pain” in his chest.\\n\\nEventually, he was diagnosed as having a severe case of acid reflux, a condition sometimes associated with guarana, one of Choco Fit’s ingredients. Guarana contains caffeine, which can cause acid reflux, or heartburn, when too much is consumed.\\n\\nChoco Fit was blacklisted in Malaysia in mid-2019, but Fauzi had suffered its ill effects by then.\\n\\nSome cases end in tragedy. When Haji Wanang was diagnosed with kidney failure, his family looked to all kinds of heath products until they came across a milk supplement online, with claims that it could help those with kidney disease.\\n\\nHaji Wanang.\\n\\nHis son Mohammad Rosli said: “There were kidney patients saying that it was good. There were photo captions stating that the patient had kidney failure for a very long time, but after taking this milk, the patient was fine.\\n\\n“We thought it was perfect.”\\n\\nTwo months later, Haji was diagnosed as having liver damage, to which he recently succumbed. This was traced to the milk supplement, following confirmation that other kidney patients who had taken the supplement suffered the same problems.\\n\\n“As a son, I feel regret,” said Rosli. “I’m angry at the person who sold it to us. I’m angry at the company who made the product.”\\n\\nMohammad Rosli.\\n\\nBATTLE AGAINST UNREGISTERED PRODUCTS\\n\\nOne of the challenges faced by Malaysia is the illegal sale of unregistered health products. In August, the Health Ministry seized unregistered health and beauty products worth RM9.7 million. They were all sold online through e-commerce platforms or drop-ship agents.\\n\\nSome contained steroids and other controlled substances.\\n\\n“When we say unregulated or unregistered products, it means they’ve not gone through the evaluation process. So the terms of quality and safety of the products aren’t ensured,” said Hasenah Ali, the director of the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA).\\n\\n“The unregistered product might contain harmful substances, so it’s very dangerous for (the public) … When you take it for a very long period of time, it can cause any side effect, which we’d never know.”\\n\\nHer agency tests health products for safety and efficacy before they can be approved for sale.\\n\\nDr Hasenah Ali.\\n\\nIt is, however, a game of cat and mouse because Malaysia has hundreds of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).\\n\\nThey are legitimate factories, and many are part of the supply chain for reputable nutritional products. But they can also make it easy for anyone to bring out a new line of products on any e-commerce platform, with little oversight.\\n\\nThey can do this by adjusting the ingredients and tweaking the formulas of existing products to meet their clients’ needs.\\n\\n“Say you’ve used one product, and it works for you. Now you want us to make a similar product,” cited an employee of one OEM visited by Undercover Asia.\\n\\n“So you give us a sample of it, we refer to it a bit and we can make a new formula.\\n\\n“For example, if that existing product has Vitamin A and C, you want a new product and you want to enhance it with Vitamin E, we can do that.”\\n\\nOEM factories in the Klang Valley.\\n\\nUndercover Asia arranged its own tests for banned or restricted ingredients by bringing five products — two OEM samples and three others that were widely available online — to a laboratory.\\n\\nOne of these, a whitening pill, was found to contain hydroquinone, a chemical the NPRA has restricted and which should not be taken orally.\\n\\nThis battle against unregistered medicines has become more acute amid the pandemic, with pharmaceutical products declared to be a cure for COVID-19 being sold online. The government has blocked at least 182 websites that sold such products.\\n\\nBETTER INFORMED, BETTER SERVED\\n\\nThe authorities also do routine inspections of premises. But with online marketing, the work has become harder, said Mokhtar Abdullah, deputy director of advertisement control at the Health Ministry’s Pharmacy Enforcement Division.\\n\\nMany people get their information about health products from the internet, unlike in the past when pharmacists and printed material, like pamphlets and posters, were the main sources, he noted.\\n\\nMr Mokhtar Abdullah\\n\\n“If we find out that any advertisement goes against our rules and regulations, we can ask (the platform) to take down the advertisement,” he added.\\n\\n“But when we ask (for) one advertisement to be removed … there’d be another 10 or 20 new advertisements that would come up.”\\n\\nEven someone like actress and social media influencer Adrea Abdullah, who endorses and reviews health and beauty products, finds it “very scary” that there are “dodgy” products out there.\\n\\nShe is concerned that “quite a few” personalities who are hired to do product promotions do not use the products themselves, especially in the long run.\\n\\nWATCH: Malaysia’s health supplements boom — What are the side effects? (46:48)\\n\\n“They know there’s something wrong with (the product), but they can’t say anything because they’ve already signed a contract,” she said. “That’s the hard bit. They can’t … say, ‘oh, it’s actually bad’, because they’re going to get sued.”\\n\\nTarmizi believes that while regular enforcement is necessary, “education is much more important” in helping vulnerable consumers who may seek an alternative remedy to their health problems.\\n\\n“If there’s no demand, there’s no need for it. If there are a lot of products (and) people pay hundreds of thousands to produce the supplements, (but) if no one’s buying … they’d stop,” said the surgeon.\\n\\nFauzi is sharing his experience for that reason. “I hope the public is more aware and does more research. Do make sure that the product is certified by the Health Ministry,” he said.\\n\\nWatch this episode of Undercover Asia here. The programme airs on Saturdays at 9pm.\",\n",

While Singapore, along with Hong Kong and United Kingdom, has recently banned visitors from India to control the risk of the spread, some have asked whether authorities should have shut the borders to travellers from India earlier.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey have expressed worry over whether other considerations were prioritised over public safety.\\n\\n\\n\\nYet, Singapore’s strategy for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic has been calibrated to ensure some resumption of travel flows to enable economic activity, mitigated by strict quarantines on arrival. Those returning from high-risk places are subjected to longer quarantine and more testing.\\n\\nWe know this strategy is not fool-proof.\\n\\nThere is a very small chance the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests – effective at 99.5 per cent – do not reveal those with infections and imported cases could spill into the local community, especially if people have let their guard down after months of conscientiously adhering to strict safe-distancing protocols.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn this, citizens voicing their concerns to the government is accepted as part and parcel of a healthy democracy. People can voice their opinion on how situations should be managed based on the values they hold dear – in this case a high prioritisation of health over the economy.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut such discourse becomes a problem when concerns expressed are laced with xenophobia or racism.\\n\\nThe understandable fear of the potential spread of the virus and the demand for the government to effectively control it, should not lead to the condemnation and blaming of the entire Indian immigrant community.\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE OTHER VIRUS REARS ITS HEAD\\n\\n\\n\\nSingapore residents surely know this. More than 60 per cent of those polled in an Institute of Policy Studies study were concerned over increased suspicion between people of different social backgrounds as a result of COVID-19. This figure is based on 22 waves of online polls.\\n\\nPedestrians wearing face masks crossing a road on Apr 29, 2020. (File photo: Calvin Oh)\\n\\nThe good news is there is some self-awareness. About one in four respondents reported becoming more negative about immigrants, including those from India, because of the pandemic.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe persistence of bigoted behaviour before and during this pandemic suggests such attitudes are deep rooted. Inoculation attempts to reduce xenophobia through public education have not been effective with some segments of the population.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis scapegoating must end. It is counterproductive to efforts to build social cohesion in a society which cannot do without a healthy balance of immigrant workers to sustain economic and caregiving activities.\\n\\n\\n\\nImmigrants with access to social media feel marginalised when they come across these hateful comments.\\n\\nMany of them contribute substantially to the progress and development of the country, including by managing essential services. Anti-immigrant rhetoric can reduce their motivation to give their best efforts to a society which does not regard them positively.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile xenophobic comments online may not necessarily translate to bigoted offline engagement, individuals fuelled by such comments online may act in a socially irresponsible manner.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis can include a refusal to sit or stand next to someone who looks like an immigrant, hurling hurtful comments at immigrants, or even acts of physical violence. The consequences of such acts can be disastrous.\\n\\n\\n\\nMoreover, scapegoating could weaken Singapore’s ability to deal with the pandemic.\\n\\nWhen immigrants believe they are targeted as potential vectors of infection, they may be more wary of seeking medical attention promptly at the sign of early symptoms. They fear that a COVID-19 diagnosis will exacerbate the wider community's sentiments towards them.\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMBATING HATE\\n\\n\\n\\nSingapore must take ownership to tackle anti-immigrant sentiments in our community exacerbated by the pandemic.\\n\\n\\n\\nFile photo of pedestrians wearing protective face masks while crossing a road in Orchard Rd, Singapore on Sep 4, 2020.

People should be reminded they might want to distinguish any unhappiness with the COVID-19 situation from immigrant policies and these from the immigrant.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe should also highlight the many contributions immigrants make to our society.\\n\\n\\n\\nEven if our comments are outnumbered by the number of negative sentiments, the presence of some supportive posts can go a long way in signalling to the discriminated that they have allies and are not alone.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe have worked too hard and far too long to build this city, teeming with diversity, to allow COVID-19 to threaten our multicultural way of life.

Sometimes, there is market dominance in certain countries and sectors, as homegrown players like Gojek may achieve in Indonesia.\\n\\nYet what is more remarkable is how many of these new big techs have demonstrated an ability to perform well in many of the disparate markets in Southeast Asia, in a way that creates a natural barrier to entry to other new challengers.\\n\\n\\n\\nSoutheast Asia’s online retail market now accounts for 5 per cent of its total, but it’s on a rapid tear. E-commerce gross merchandise value grew 23 per cent per year from 2018 to 2020, faster than the compounded annual growth rate of China’s, India’s, and the United States’ GMV during the same period, according to Bain.\\n\\nThe fact that Grab wants to stay focused on this “massive” ASEAN growth story, rather than spread out even further, is saying something.\\n\\n\\n\\nALTERNATIVE TO CHINA PLAYS\\n\\n\\n\\nIn contrast, Chinese companies listed on US markets now represent bigger risks for investors. As US-China geopolitical rivalry heats up, damp sentiment is weighing on Chinese firms listing in the US. There is a rise of Chinese firms listing on the US markets so far this year but geopolitical concerns are causing lacklustre debuts.\\n\\n\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: Chinese electric vehicle start-up Nio Inc. vehicles are on display in front of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to celebrate the company’s initial public offering (IPO) in New York, U.S., September 12, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\\n\\nJust as Grab was getting ready to receive billions in its SPAC listing, Alibaba was hit with a record antitrust fine of US$2.8 billion for what the state called abusing its market dominance. The increasingly assertive stance of the Chinese government towards tech players is part of a big shift in the regulation of China’s digital space.\\n\\n\\n\\nInterestingly the Gojeks and Grabs of the world have been particularly good at staying on the right sides of governments as regulators play catch up with their outsized growth.\\n\\n\\n\\nGrab started out by tapping into the existing fleet of taxis, helping customers to “just Grab” any taxi available, rather than call different companies. Now it offers a suite of services, including private-hire cars. This was a starkly different approach to Uber, which went head-to-head with taxi companies, sparking societal concerns and lawsuits.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor Gojek, the pivotal decision to initially concentrate on ojeks (motorcycle taxis), for example, was doubly context-savvy: It skirted direct competition with Jakarta’s existing taxi industry, while dodging the nation’s transport regulations, which applied only to four-wheeled vehicles.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy the time the app introduced four-wheelers in 2016, Gojek had already cultivated a public profile as a boon to the local economy and a patriotic symbol of Indonesian progress.\\n\\n\\n\\nSUPER APPS CUT THROUGH SUPER COMPLEXITY\\n\\n\\n\\nFor all its merit, Southeast Asia is complex. Transport infrastructure is often hard to negotiate and services difficult to deliver, especially in Indonesia.\\n\\n\\n\\nApps like Gojek have helped riders enormously by opening up a customer base to optimise where they locate themselves and offered them other delivery jobs when ride demand is low during the day.\\n\\n\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: Gojek driver helmets are seen during Go-Food festival in Jakarta, Indonesia, Oct 27, 2018. (Photo: REUTERS/Beawiharta)\\n\\nThe approach of the super apps also differs widely from the Amazons and Ubers of the world, which concentrate on a few services and do them really well.\\n\\nA big population of willing servers helps Grab and Gojek add more services and spread them out over a wider area. A deep and local understanding of Southeast Asian nuances helps.\\n\\n\\n\\nInstead of getting into these segments itself, it’s interesting that Amazon is investing big in cloud computing to support growing tech development in Southeast Asia rather than try to eat Lazada or Gojek’s lunch.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are cultural nuances too. Shopee is capturing eyeballs with bargain hunting and flash deals. Such social commerce (group and gamified buying) is the next frontier in e-commerce.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are two main reasons for the increasing interest in social commerce.\\n\\nThe first is that people are growing weary of big tech’s advertising-driven approach to e-commerce. For example, users are growing tired of being bombarded by ads and influencers telling them what to buy.\\n\\nSecond is that privacy concerns are weighing on consumers’ and legislators’ minds. The more customer-driven group buying models avoid this approach.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe super apps are also backed by huge investments of US and Chinese money, the investors content to duke it out through their proxies rather than compete directly.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Shopee 2.2 CNY Sale offers deals and discounts. (Photo: Shopee)\\n\\nOther tech unicorns in the region, such as Traveloka and Property Guru are also considering listing through blank-cheque SPACs in the US and Gojek is consolidating its position by merging with Tokopedia, which will make it a transport and e-commerce giant.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe competition is heating up and it looks like we’re just at the beginning.\\n\\nAs my colleague, Guoli Chen, Strategy Professor at INSEAD has pointed out before, one major reason for Grab’s listing is its need for additional capital to maintain its leading position in ride hailing, food delivery and digital finance, to defend itself from incursions by Sea, the largest tech firm in Southeast Asia.\\n\\n\\n\\nFinally, these listings may benefit the entrepreneurial ecosystem more broadly. Major liquidity events, like the Grab listing, will also enable exits for private investors, which typically unlock capital to start other companies and make other investments.\\n\\n\\n\\nJason Davis is an Associate Professor of Entrepreneurship and Family Enterprise at INSEAD.\",\n",
              " 'What does it take to be \"one of us\"? Singaporeans\\' obsessions in defining the \"us\" in this latest episode stems not only from a fixation on labels but insecurities amid seismic changes in society, says SUSS\\' Dr Leong Chan-Hoong.\\n\\nSINGAPORE: Are you a Singaporean? Did you embrace our way of life?\\n\\nIt does not require a genius to see the subtext in discussions over our daily headline news whenever the term “foreign” is mentioned in the media. This happens both when someone has misbehaved or achieved an extraordinary feat in a profession.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWe saw this most recently last week when TikTok, the social media giant named 39-year old Chew Shou Zhi its new CEO.\\n\\nChew, who is based in Singapore, was previously the CFO at ByteDance. Prior to that, he was part of the senior management team in Xiaomi, another Chinese tech behemoth.\\n\\nChew has been said to have the deep knowledge of the industry and is part of the Chinese inner circle. He was instrumental in securing much needed financing from investors and played a huge role in seeing through Xiaomi’s listing.\\n\\nThe corporate announcement understandably and instantaneously triggered lively discussions.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe business community commented on the role that Singapore play in the global corporate ecosystem, while netizens took a greater interest in Chew\\'s personal life. Specifically, they asked - is he a native-born or naturalised Singaporean? Did he serve National Service (NS)?\\n\\nMany have recalled tales of his kind acts in NS, putting to bed most of these questions.\\n\\nYet, Chew is not the first to be publicly scrutinised on his citizenship background and his allegiance and neither will he be the last.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDilhan Pillay Sandrasegara, CEO-designate for Temasek Holdings, and Joseph Schooling, Singapore\\'s Olympic gold medallist, both have had similar doubts and prejudgement casted on their cultural authenticity.\\n\\nFALSE DICHOTOMY\\n\\nWhy this obsession with nativism and the meaning of Singaporean-ness? The drivers behind this national pastime is a complex mix of identity, immigration, and politics. The best way to understand this phenomenon starts with unpacking our fixation with labels.\\n\\nHuman are cognitive misers. We prefer to make sense of the world - our problems in particular - using a simple and usually binary prism.\\n\\nLike a divine programming code imprinted in our cultural DNA, events, people, things, are classified as either good or bad, right or wrong. This constructed dichotomy gives us a false sense of control.\\n\\nInvalid email address It looks like the email address you entered is not valid. Try Again This service is not intended for persons residing in the EU. By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive news updates and promotional material from Mediacorp and Mediacorp\\'s partners.\\n\\nIn many cases like the news on Mr Chew, comments border on suggesting being a “true” Singaporean is somehow better than being a new citizen or permanent resident. And from this follows that to support a fellow Singaporean is a patriotic duty. Any behaviour that conforms to the normative rituals of being Singaporean is a virtue.\\n\\nXiaomi founder, Chairman and CEO Lei Jun and CFO Shou Zi Chew attend the listing of the company at the Hong Kong Exchanges in Hong Kong, China July 9, 2018. (Photo: REUTERS/Bobby Yip)\\n\\nIn a similar vein, to support a non-Singaporean is a betrayal, and any behaviour that deviates from our prescribed list must be a sin.\\n\\nThis proclivity for a mental short-cut is not novel. We have seen how populist leaders in America use this heuristic to great devastation.\\n\\nUnder President Donald Trump\\'s administration, we saw a fixation on persecuting foreign adversaries.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis political movement, though shocking, was earlier displayed in McCarthyism in the 1950s, when Americans went on a protracted witch hunt for domestic infiltration of communists. The underlying belief was that by ridding America of all communists, life could suddenly be improved and the security of the nation guaranteed.\\n\\nSuch sentiments during the Cold War, where there was an existential threat, are understandable though this dichotomy is far more nuanced today. That is partially because there is more similarity than differences among the contemporary waves of immigrants to Singapore.\\n\\nEven if Mr Chew, Mr Pillay and Mr Schooling were immigrants, they would behave like a globalite just like most of Singapore\\'s native-born yet well-travelled and incredibly exposed population. We probably consume Netflix, Starbucks, and Haagen-Dazs ice cream to the same extent as other residents in global cities.\\n\\nAnd yet we embrace this strict binary of identities, which comes with an assumed hierarchy. This does nothing but fosters an imaginary divide between us and them.\\n\\nTHE ESSENTIAL SINGAPORE IDENTITY\\n\\nYes, we have a Singaporean identity and feel proud about it.\\n\\nMembers of public wearing protective face masks at Orchard Road in Singapore on Sep 4, 2020. (Photo: Marcus Mark Ramos)\\n\\nOur respect for the rule of law, multi-racialism, fulfilling one\\'s obligation in NS or reciting the pledge, are examples of the common markers people say make us Singaporean that are positive and to be welcomed. We expect immigrants and non-residents alike to respect these boundaries, and rightly so.\\n\\nYet when an immigrant behaves badly, we criticise their flawed character and assume this must be because they are “un-Singaporean”.\\n\\n\\n\\nIronically, when they achieve success at the international podium, we focused on the unfair advantages they enjoy, like exemption from NS among the first-generation residents.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuch imposed standards of becoming Singaporean are impossible for new residents to meet. From assumed character flaws to not serving NS, the barriers to becoming one of \"us\" is endless.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is not to suggest that identity markers are not important, but that they are not exclusive. You can be a non-Singaporean who made substantial contributions to Singapore.\\n\\nELEPHANT IN THE ROOM\\n\\nThe angst about Singapore identity is also about the politics of migration as much as about the lack of social integration among some immigrants.\\n\\nThere is a palpable sense of economic and cultural insecurity in the mid of seismic changes in our demography, workforce, and regional geopolitics.\\n\\nIt does not help that at times the domestic political rhetoric gives the impression that the state pays greater attention to the interest of the non-native born – in speeches that talk about protecting jobs for Singaporeans during this COVID-19 pandemic for example.\\n\\nTwo years ago, a Singapore naturalised citizen was caught on video shouting and using vulgarity at a condominium security guard for enforcing a rule that requires visitors to pay S$10 if they park their cars in the premise after 11pm.\\n\\nThe incident went viral overnight, drawing thousands of viewers and their condemnation in a matter of days, ostensibly for the utter lack of respect to our orderly conscious culture, and for the offensive words he used in support of a upper-class privilege he deemed to be his entitlement.\\n\\nHow or why should a person of such character be allowed to settle here, the netizens asked?\\n\\nIt took a couple of day before a senior political leader spoke out against the obnoxious behaviour. “What this resident did and said was wrong – at some many levels” said Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam.\\n\\nAs he hints, this incident wasn’t about nationality but norms of decent human behaviour. Criticisms of the man should stop at the water’s edge.\\n\\n(Should Singaporeans get priority when a new job opens? Listen to Labour MP Patrick Tay and CEO of the Economic Development Board Chng Kai Fong unpack the rules, considerations and challenges firms face in CNA\\'s Heart of the Matter podcast:)\\n\\nTHE BIG PICTURE: NATIONAL NARRATIVE\\n\\nHistorically, we are not just another immigrant society but one where both long- and short-term residents share the same national narratives.\\n\\nNational narratives, unlike identity markers like NS, are broader and more omnipotent charters that bind us as one regardless of residency status.\\n\\nThe principles we have collectively come to adopt - such as a market-driven economy, and making Singapore a fair and equal society for all - have defined this national narrative, which have in turn centred around resilience, a unique brand of exceptionalism in-spite of being small, open and racially diverse.\\n\\nSingapore’s national narrative of resilience has deep roots. At the time of our independence, everyone regardless of citizens or foreign nationals, have all committed to make this city-state thrive.\\n\\nThere were conflicts, anger and anxiety over the years, but that did not affect the audacity to dream of a better future.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe global standards we have set and strong institutions we have built - a world-class education system, a premium international airline, and a harmonious society the envy of developed nations - are but reminders we have beaten the odds.\\n\\nToday, we face a generational crisis of confidence. In a world upended by a raging pandemic and saturated with socio-economic uncertainty, narrowing the definition of “us” not only makes for a false sense of agency but can be counterproductive and divisive.\\n\\nMr Chew, Mr Pillay and Mr Schooling have made exceptional advances in their respective careers.\\n\\nThey are a part of “us” and we should celebrate their achievements and encourage more to reach for the stars as part of Singapore Inc.\\n\\nLeong Chan-Hoong is Associate Professor at the Centre for Applied Research, Singapore University of Social Sciences.He is the Singapore National Representative for the World Association for Public Opinion Research, and the Chair for the Rae and Dan Landis Outstanding PhD Dissertation Award, at the International Academy for Intercultural Research.',\n",
              " \"The aim to reduce exam stress cannot work when the bigger educational eco-system makes it a race to the finish for parents, says Cherie Tseng.\\n\\nSINGAPORE: For a world that loves to Konmari their home, embrace the minimalist lifestyle and share little Instagram posters about not sweating the details, we are oddly enamoured by life scorecards like Tik Tok likes, Facebook shares and Amazon reviews.\\n\\nBig data, trends, patterns — we like it when we have information on performance and how something or someone is doing. Indicators of the state of play. And nowhere is this played out more keenly than in the nation’s Primary School Leaving Exams (PSLE).\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nOn Tuesday (Apr 27), the Ministry of Education (MOE) released indicative PSLE scores for secondary schools, following the new PSLE scoring system.\\n\\nMOE had scrapped the traditional old T-Score system, and replaced it with the Achievement Level (AL) scoring system.\\n\\nUnlike the T-Score system that ranks a student's performance in the PSLE in relation to his peers, the AL system assigns each pupil a score based on how well he or she has done in the subject, independent of how others fare.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThis year’s Primary 6 students will be the inaugural batch under the new system.\\n\\nTo quell the uncertainty on the ground over the new AL system, MOE released simulated cut-off points for secondary schools. Scores were generated based on the 2020 cohort's PSLE results and school choice patterns, simulating each pupil's individual subject score in AL terms and adding the scores for each subject to form the total PSLE score.\\n\\nIt shouldn’t be shocking yet the news triggered an upheaval in parent chatgroups across the island. Within the hour, people had consolidated lists of cut-of-points of all the schools, with discussion on the accuracy of the simulated scores was rife.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSome fretted about how their children could do when some bands had wide mark ranges and the implications for their secondary school posting.\\n\\nA friend said her stress level spiked. Another said this added even more uncertainty to an already unpredictable year.\\n\\nWe cannot help ourselves because of how important national examinations are and by extension, the fervent lengths parents and students generally go to do well in sunny Singapore.\\n\\nPARENTS VS THE SYSTEM\\n\\nTake the Direct School’s Admission for secondary school (DSA) for instance. It allows Primary 6 students to seek admission based on their talent in sports, co-curricular activities and academic areas.\\n\\nInvalid email address It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

Apply for school entry on the merits of your ball-kicking prowess.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the system, favours the better connected and better heeled. Since it is hard to differentiate between the many Grade 8 music applicants, you’d be looking at other achievements like competition outcomes and even a personal portfolio - something wealthier families have easier access to be it to pay for masterclasses or to fly overseas to take part in a luminary competition.\\n\\n(Photo: Unsplash/Siniz Kim)\\n\\nConsider, even, the Primary 1 and 2 report-card system where, instead of grades, students are accorded levels of competency to specific learning outcomes: Beginning, Developing, Competent and Accomplished.\\n\\nThe aim of this is to focus on a child’s learning progress instead of how well they tested. While this removes the glaringness of a raw score, for most parents, they simply equate an A grade to Accomplished, B grade to a Competent assessment and so forth.\\n\\nAnd the same question remains: How do I get my child to the next level? It is true that the old T-score system drives parents, teachers and student alike to prime for even one extra mark, but the new AL system might simply make people push to level up by a whole band.\\n\\nOr perhaps, there may added interest in pursuing the DSA route and we’d see students pushed to excel both in class and out. All of this is well intended but what are the costs of a parent desperately advocating for their child?\\n\\nAnother example of how things are different and yet the same: The differences in entry scores for affiliated students versus non-affiliated ones. For example, Maris Stella High has an indicative range of eight to 16 points for affiliated students and seven to 12 for non-affiliated students entering its express O-Level course.\\n\\nYes, this system of affiliation has been in place for many years now but all parents see when confronted by these numbers is that the stakes at the start of the journey are still high.\\n\\nThis is why we will still have folks emptying their wallets for a home near a top school at Primary One, to ensure that even if junior doesn’t make the cut on his own, all those affiliated discounts will see him through to secondary four.\\n\\nCan we blame them?\\n\\nIS IT REALLY ABOUT EXAMS OR EXAM STRESS?\\n\\nWhen you strip things bare, people don’t have an issue with examinations per se.\\n\\nThey decry the stressfulness that comes with the turf, the nagging parenting self-doubt about how far to help or push the child, and even the inconvenience of weathering the examination season.\\n\\nIs success defined by a single sheet of paper?\\n\\nWhile the Ministry has taken great pains to tell parents this is better, I am not holding my breath that this new PSLE scoring iteration will inherently change how any stakeholders actually behave.\\n\\nThe signs have always been there.\\n\\nSchools will scrap mid-year exams permanently for some levels, but it its place are still “weighted assessments” whose grade still counts to a child’s yearly performance.\\n\\nThe scope of what is tested is certainly smaller, but the weightage is still substantial. And so, the truth is, the trudge for students and parents continues.\\n\\nSchools may have done away with many scoring awards, but at the least, at the end of each year, the top quintile of each cohort still gets a merit bursary award from their Community Development Councils (CDC).\\n\\nWith some sort of grade or other still in play, the multi-billion dollar tuition industry is unlikely to change. Parents and students will likely still semi-willingly march behind.\\n\\nIt is hard to truly believe in a learning panacea when Singapore’s office bearers admit that meritocracy will remain a key principle for recognising individuals in Singapore.”\\n\\nThis is ironic when sociologist Michael Young who coined the term “Meritocracy” back in the 1950s meant it not so much as a plea for opportunities for all, but as a warning against a system that reduces humans to units of merit.\\n\\nLayer on the fact that our O-level examination results is stored even in our Singpass - it sends a dichotomous message: Please, children of Singapore, know that you are not your grade. But by the way, adults, your grades will haunt you for the rest of your life.\\n\\nWHAT NEEDLE ARE WE HOPING TO MOVE?\\n\\nI can fully appreciate the logic behind this new PSLE scoring system. It is hard not to feel that the new AL system misses the mark not in its intention, but in its assumption that the everyday Singapore parent is able to rise above the tyranny of (well-meaning) kiasuism.\\n\\nIt is hubris to say we need the conversation to be less about scoring rubric and more about the purpose of learning, where learning is more about process, less about project success; more about application and not just knowledge cumulation and regurgitating.\\n\\nOr suggest that we need a lighter syllabus and a less pedantic way of awarding marks.\\n\\nStudents attending a class at a primary school. (File photo: TODAY)\\n\\nThe conversation we should have, perhaps, is less about what needs to be done, and more about how we need to change in defining what makes a good student in school and of life.\\n\\nThe conundrum is how to divorce the rabid race of grade-point one-upmanship from the intended purposes of examinations.\\n\\nIt almost makes me wish for a simpler time, with a less complicated system, where I could go to a school near my home and if I did well, was able to progress by sheer dint of hard work. My children face quite a different world.\\n\\nAs we have done before, parents will need to march on and address our own expectations. Dr Abishek Mathew Abraham, Senior Psychiatrist and Medical Director of Better Life Clinic suggests: “ We need to shift the conversation away from a ‘my life depends on this moment’ to a ‘this is a journey of growth with progress and setbacks’.”\\n\\n“Students, parents, teachers and adults need to realise that success is not an end state. Our lives are not unfulfilled, bad or of less value just because we meet with a setback.”\\n\\nNow if only we can remember this each time we get frustrated that our children are not keeping up with the kid next door or feel deflated when reading about a straight-A student praised on Facebook.\\n\\nCherie Tseng is Chief Operations Officer at a local fintech company, a mother of three and editor with The Birthday Collective.\\n\\n\\n\\n(Listen to three working adults reveal how their PSLE results have shaped their life journeys in a no-holds barred conversation on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast:)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
              " \"Even as climate change intensifies the call for decarbonisation, the oil and gas sector will play a pivotal role in Singapore, say EY consultants.\\n\\nSINGAPORE: The oil and gas sector is widely seen as a sunset industry.\\n\\nWrite-downs of around US$145 billion (S$193.7 billion) in asset values globally over the first three quarters in 2020 have added to that perspective.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSingapore, while not a domestic oil producer, has high stakes in this sector. The country is a global oil trading hub and a major global refining and petrochemicals center, accounting for 1.5 million barrels a day or 1.5 per cent of the global refining volume, and 25 million tonnes per annum or 1.2 per cent of the global petrochemicals capacity.\\n\\nIt also thrives on a large shipping industry and is one of the main shipping bunkering stations in the world, given its strategic location.\\n\\nBut that may change as the world transitions away from fossil fuels. There is little disagreement that burning them contributes to climate change and other adverse environmental effects.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe pandemic and other world events in 2020 have brought climate change and sustainability to the fore for businesses, governments and communities.\\n\\nThe oil and gas industry is similarly stepping up its response to climate change. For instance, The Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, led by a consortium of global industry players, has set aside US$1 billion to catalyse the shift to a low-carbon ecosystem.\\n\\nInstitutional investors are scrutinising companies’ actions and resilience towards climate change. Public policies will increasingly be oriented toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuels’ share in the energy mix.\\n\\nIn an ideal world, we would flip a switch and the energy ecosystem would be transformed. Electric vehicles would instantly replace those powered by internal combustion engines. Electricity would be generated by solar panels and windmills.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHowever, the reality is it takes time for consumer adoption, technology, regulations and infrastructure to come together. Oil and gas players must tackle the clean energy transition head-on and confront the “sunset” outlook for the sector.\\n\\nOIL COMPANIES HAVE HUGE ROLE IN CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION\\n\\nWhile exploration and production may arguably be considered as “sunsetting” segments, major oil companies can face this clean energy transition with confidence.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: Oil tankers pass through the Strait of Hormuz, December 21, 2018.

They possess operational experience in the most challenging environments and have the ability to attract capital.\\n\\nThe energy transition is well underway as oil and gas companies decarbonise and invest in new technologies.\\n\\nMajor European oil companies such as BP, Shell and Eni have already announced plans to invest in the energy transition in one way or another; in renewables, carbon capture, utilisation and storage, hydrogen and buying green electricity.\\n\\nMost oil majors are investing in solar energy, a key source of future energy for Asia-Pacific. Examples include BP’s investment in the Lightsource Joint Venture; Eni’s recent commissioning of a 31MW solar power plant in Italy and similar projects in Australia, Tunisia, Pakistan and Kazakhstan.\\n\\nShell also has five solar projects and plans to build a 120MW solar plant in Australia, which will help reduce its carbon emissions by 300,000 tonnes per year.\\n\\nOffshore wind too is particularly attractive for oil and gas companies as there are significant cost synergies with offshore oil and gas platforms. China and Europe are leading regions for offshore wind developments.\\n\\nWhile the energy mix is shifting towards more renewables, given the lack of stable renewable energy and accelerated energy demand in the region, the use of gas will likely remain important in providing energy to Asia as the region works toward reducing carbon emissions.\\n\\nThe International Energy Agency forecasts that approximately 35 per cent of the world’s electricity generation will still be coal-based in 2024. This represents an immediate fuel switch opportunity to leverage natural gas, a relatively cleaner fuel that emits about half the volume of greenhouse gas when combusted to generate electricity compared to thermal coal.\\n\\nSingapore can capitalise on its existing strengths to become a future hub for natural gas trading and redistribution. In September 2020, there were over 50 companies with a liquefied natural gas (LNG) trading or business development presence in Singapore, up from over 45 in 2018.\\n\\nWith Asia’s appetite for LNG expected to grow, players in the ecosystem will be looking to invest and establish new LNG trading desks to feed this demand. As Asia’s oil trading hub, Singapore already has the necessary trading ecosystem and infrastructure in place, which will be attractive for companies looking to expand into LNG trading.\\n\\nMaritime vessels are seen anchored on the waters south of Singapore. (File photo: AFP/ROSLAN RAHMAN)\\n\\nAdditionally, Singapore is continuing to develop the use of LNG as a marine fuel and is introducing a second LNG terminal. The country’s annual LNG bunkering capacity is expected to hit 1 million tonnes by the end of this year, as the maritime community seeks low or zero carbon fuels to meet International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO) aim to halve the sector’s greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 from 2008 levels.\\n\\nNEW CAPABILITIES NEEDED IN CLEAN ENERGY SECTOR\\n\\nAs oil and gas companies move towards low-carbon technologies, the sector will need new capabilities. This means opportunities for tech-savvy professionals to join the sector, and for incumbents in the industry to be reskilled and upskilled.\\n\\nYet, such retraining can be a challenge. According to an EY global report Oil and Gas Digital Transformation and the Workforce Survey 2020, workforce composition and training are widely acknowledged as barriers to technology adoption.\\n\\nThe skillsets needed to onboard and extract value from technologies such as data analytics, data science, design thinking and artificial intelligence far outpace the current level of maturity across the industry.\\n\\nWith Singapore’s advanced education system and workforce transformation strategies, there is an opportunity for the country to build a pool of skilled talent and plug the skill gaps to anchor its appeal as an oil and gas hub – or perhaps even contribute as an exporter of such talents and capabilities.\\n\\nProgrammes, such as the Industry 4.0 Human Capital Initiative helmed by the Singapore Business Federation, are already in place to help companies, including those in the oil and gas sector, to be equipped with people management and job redesign skills.\\n\\nOut of the 46 companies that participated in the programme that ran between March and September 2020, the oil and gas sector was heavily represented.\\n\\nFurther, the Government’s position on advancing sustainable development offers the certainty oil and gas players need to move forward with the energy transition.\\n\\nThe announcement of the Singapore Green Plan this year establishes targets and focus areas. With policies such as the Carbon Pricing Act, which indirectly incentivise players to adopt low-carbon technologies and solutions, the country’s intent to build a greener and energy-efficient future is clear.\\n\\nThe future of oil and gas is complex. It would be premature to predict the demise of the oil and gas sector – at least not yet.\\n\\nRather, the sector needs a transformation, more urgently than before. For Singapore, whether this presents an opportunity or challenge will depend on how well it enables and integrates the sector’s evolution into its overall sustainable development plan.\\n\\nWhat will it take for Big Oil to transition into a low-carbon world?

Instead of asking “why would someone do that to her?” we tend to instead direct our ire at the person in the photograph, asking “why did you take that photo?”\\n\\nWe zero in on an individual woman and condemn her, without paying heed to the context in which the photo was taken or the content of the photo itself.\\n\\nWHAT TYPE OF PICTURES GO ONLINE\\n\\nOver the course of an eight-year relationship, Sara* exchanged intimate photos with her boyfriend.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nPhoto illustration of a man taking upskirt photos. (Photo: Jeremy Long)\\n\\nBut when she wanted to end things, he threatened to release those photos and videos if she went through with the break up. Scared and tired of the emotional abuse she was facing, she sought help from our centre.\\n\\nSara’s case falls into a first category of photos that are non-consensually circulated online. These are photos and videos co-created by couples in the context of a romantic, often sexual relationship.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe voluntary sharing of intimate photos can be an expression of love and intimacy. They form a part of the cultural phenomenon of “sexting”, an increasingly common part of adult romantic relationships.\\n\\nBut they transform into TFSV when they are shared non-consensually, either via hacking, or when the initial recipients or co-creators disseminate them without the victim’s knowledge and consent.\\n\\nInvalid email address It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive news updates and promotional material from Mediacorp and Mediacorp\\'s partners.\\n\\nA second category of photos are taken by someone known to the victim, but their creation and dissemination are non-consensual.\\n\\nWe often see such visuals emerge in the context of domestic violence, with their production and distribution means of control.\\n\\nA client of ours, Ayesha* shared that her ex-boyfriend forced her to take nude photos and videos and sent these explicit materials to her family members after she filed a police report against him for harassment.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe third category are photos obtained through voyeurism - including upskirting, and photos taken while a woman is sleeping or in the shower. These might be non-consensually created and distributed, or used for private “consumption”.\\n\\nImage shared by Twitter user Mishap_bella shows the Telegram chat group \"SG Nasi Lemak\" blocked on iPhone.\\n\\nFinally, we have innocent images taken from women and girls’ own social media accounts and shared on chat groups without their consent. While accounts might be set to public or private, the photos are subject to a torrent of sexualised comments and framing after being shared on illicit groups.\\n\\n\\n\\nOften these users are tweens who post everyday photos of themselves and their friends on Instagram – enjoying a meal, goofing around in the park and in many non-sexual everyday activities. Sometimes the photos are digitally altered to exaggerate certain body parts.\\n\\nIn these Telegram chats, personal details of the victim, such as their name, address and links to social media profiles, are shared alongside visuals, turning non-consensual online circulation into offline abuse, including stalking, sexual harassment and assault.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe effects can be wide-reaching. Half of 1,244 victims who had reached out to the US Cyber Civil Rights Initiatives had seen their full names and social media profiles published alongside their images. Over 20 per cent reported that their email addresses and phone numbers were published along with their images.\\n\\n(How do videos and photos of innocent victims end up on disgusting illicit Telegram chats? CNA\\'s Heart of the Matter dives into how one young woman infiltrated those groups and reached out to victims:)\\n\\n\\n\\nASSIGN BLAME ON THOSE RESPONSIBLE\\n\\nIt should be plain to see that perpetrators are culpable for TFSV, not victims. Taking a photograph of yourself, or posing for a photograph, does not hurt anyone. Sharing those photographs without consent does.\\n\\nSo it does not help to focus on what women did that resulted in these Telegram chats, or chastise them for innocuous behaviour.\\n\\nFocusing on a woman’s behaviour (for example, the fact that she took an intimate photo) is at the very heart of victim-blaming.\\n\\nWe have seen a similar pattern of comments online regarding cases of sexual assault that fixate on the women’s decisions (for example, we question if they drank alcohol and what they wore) and their reactions in the aftermath of violence, which cleverly diminishes the responsibility of the perpetrator and transfers it to victims.\\n\\nSurvivors who face victim-blaming are less likely to make police reports and seek further support in their recovery journeys. But women should not be held responsible for the behaviour of their boyfriends, husbands, exes, voyeurs, stalkers, underwear thieves or bosses who send unsolicited pictures of genitalia.\\n\\nUntil we clearly identify the point at which violence occurs, and assign blame where it belongs, we won’t see any real progress. Photos and videos of women will continue to circulate without their consent, and without accountability on the part of perpetrators.\\n\\nTeaching consent from a young age should not be a matter of choice. It should be made non-negotiable. For older children, the Council of Europe recommends that parents use real-life examples to explain the risks, dangers, and legal issues surrounding sexting.\\n\\nIf children find themselves exposed, they should have the tools to discuss how to report the offensive materials with a trusted adult and find affirming emotional support.\\n\\n\\n\\nWHAT MORE CAN BE DONE\\n\\nRecent amendments updated Singapore’s Penal Code to be relevant to the “smartphone age” by criminalising voyeurism, non-consensual creation and distribution of intimate images, and cyber sexual exposure (i.e. vulgar images). However, despite this enormous progress, it’s clear we haven’t begun to solve the problem.\\n\\nClients of AWARE’s Sexual Assault Care Centre share with us the countless hours they spend tracking down images, filing takedown requests with individual social media platforms, changing phone numbers, deleting social media accounts - all to protect themselves from further harm and achieve a modicum of relief after their privacy and autonomy is violated.\\n\\n(Photo: Pixabay/sasint)\\n\\nHuge amounts of labour goes into those efforts. Yet we know that once a photo or video is out there on the internet, there’s no telling where it may end up. And the longer photos and videos stay online, the harder they become to remove.\\n\\nWe hope the new Protection from Harassment Act courts will be sensitive to these nuances, and allow the filing of cases and issuance of takedown requests to be processed within 48 to 72 hours.\\n\\nWe can model our system after other effective ones. Australia’s Office of eSafety Commissioner responds to complaints of image-based abuse within 48 hours of official reports being filed with them.\\n\\nSocial media platforms have a very important role to play here too. They must proactively implement steps to deter non-consensual photos or videos from being shared in the first place.\\n\\nThey should be required to share information across platforms so that a non-consensual image’s digital footprint can be used to prevent it from being uploaded on a platform after it has been taken down by another, instead of requiring victims to file complaints with each individual social media platform.\\n\\nSocial media platforms need to devote more human resources to tackling such cases and provide a clear time frame within which victims can expect assistance.\\n\\nThere’s much to be done before the horrible practice of TFSV can be put to bed. But just attacking women for sharing nudes is not one of them.\\n\\nShailey Hingorani is head of research and advocacy at AWARE.\\n\\n',\n",

Shanmugam drew a comparison to populist movements in other countries, linking economic concerns to immigrants and exploiting fear for political profit.\\n\\n\"And in Singapore, we have avoided the worst of such populism, but people are concerned for their jobs, and naturally so. And among Singaporeans, legitimate concerns about foreigners taking over our jobs.

Not withstanding that many of these sites that promote xenophobia support you.\"\\n\\nLeong: We are definitely not xenophobic\\n\\nIn response to Shanmugam, Leong said that the party and himself were not xenophobic.\\n\\n\"We are just stating the economic effect of some of these free trade agreements have had on our economy, the feedback we get from many suffering Singaporeans. We still need to know the situation better, but we are definitely not xenophobic and definitely, racism has no place in our overall thinking.\"\\n\\nStressing that he was speaking about the economy and livelihoods, he said that he accepted the challenged posed by Shanmugam.\\n\\nPSP\\'s Central Executive Committee subsequently issued a statement on May 12 which slammed the recent racist attacks against Indians as unacceptable and deplorable. It said:\\n\\n\"PSP is steadfast in promoting racial harmony and equality which is enshrined in our core values and beliefs.

              " 'With less than four weeks remaining before the June 6 elections, the federal Attorney General’s Office (FGR) announced Monday it is investigating the two leading candidates for governor in Nuevo León for electoral crimes.\\n\\nThe FGR said in a statement issued Monday night that it had received complaints against Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)-Democratic Revolution Party (PRD) candidate Adrián de la Garza for using social programs for political purposes – effectively vote buying – and against Citizens Movement (MC) party candidate Samuel García for receiving resources of “illicit origin” and using them for electoral gain.\\n\\nThe case against de la Garza, who is second in most polls behind García, is related to asking for women’s votes in exchange for a so-called “pink card,” which they could use to withdraw cash if the PRI-PRD candidate wins the election.\\n\\nThe FGR said that offering the cards to women amounts to vote-buying, a tactic with which the once omnipotent PRI has long been associated. It noted that it has received a “large number of citizens complaints” against de la Garza for “violating article 19 of the constitution, which orders preventative prison for the use of social programs with electoral purposes.”\\n\\nHowever, the FGR didn’t say whether it would seek to detain the candidate, a former mayor of Monterrey.\\n\\nThe case against García, a former senator perhaps best known for scolding his wife for “showing too much leg” during an Instagram Live video last August, relates to “allegedly criminal acts” committed by him, his father, his wife and his wife’s father, the FGR said.\\n\\nThe Attorney General’s Office said it has received several complaints, including one from the federal government’s Financial Intelligence Unit, against the candidate and his family members for allegedly committing offenses set out in article 15 of the General Electoral Crimes Law, “which refers to contributions in money or kind, as well as funds or goods of illicit origin, used illegally for electoral purposes.”\\n\\nThe announcement of the investigation into de la Garza comes just days after President López Obrador accused him of vote-buying at two successive press conferences last week, triggering claims that the supposedly autonomous FGR had been ordered to conduct a probe.\\n\\n“A coincidence or could it be that they follow orders from the National Palace at the Attorney General’s Office?” asked columnist Salvador García Soto in the newspaper El Universal.\\n\\nHe also wrote that if anyone doubted that López Obrador and his government were willing to do anything to maintain and gain power, the FGR’s announcement confirmed that they are. Using the FGR to go after two opposition candidates who are leading the polls is a “subject of scandal” and a “clear political use of a supposedly autonomous institution,” García Soto wrote.\\n\\nStanding to benefit from the FGR’s probe into the two leading candidates is the aspirant for Morena – Mexico’s ruling party – Clara Luz Flores, who trails both de la Garza and García by a double digit margin, according to a recent Reforma newspaper poll.\\n\\nDe la Garza, who has also faced allegations of links to organized crime, said in a Twitter message Monday night that he is a victim of political persecution for “proposing to protect the women of Nuevo León.”\\n\\nFor his part, García said that the only thing he is guilty of is “shooting up in the polls.”\\n\\n“I’m convinced that the only reason behind all the complaints, attacks and defamations that have emerged in recent weeks against me and my family is that we’re going to win the governorship of Nuevo León,” he wrote on Twitter.\\n\\nThe MC candidate also said he is willing to collaborate with authorities because “I have nothing to hide – there is no irregularity in my campaign and even less so in my personal and professional life.”\\n\\nPRI national president Alejandro Moreno claimed that the FGR’s announcement of its investigation into de la Garza is designed as a distraction from last week’s train crash on the Mexico City Metro system that claimed the lives of 26 people.\\n\\nThe Citizens Movement party’s national leader, Clemente Castañeda, called on López Obrador to “keep his hands off the electoral process.”\\n\\nThe governorship of Nuevo León – currently held by Jaime Rodríguez, a 2018 presidential candidate widely known as “El Bronco” – is seen as one of the biggest prizes on offer at the June 6 elections, at which governors will also be elected in 14 other states and the entire lower house of federal Congress will be renewed.\\n\\nAt his regular news conference on Tuesday, López Obrador – Morena’s founder – expressed support for the FGR’s decision to investigate the two candidates in Nuevo León, asserting that “we cannot be accomplices of fraud.”\\n\\n“… Yesterday the spokespeople of conservatism were throwing their hands up in horror because the Attorney General’s Office opened an investigation against the Nuevo León candidates; I support that decision, I denounced [de la Garza] here, because [buying votes] is an electoral crime,” he said.\\n\\nSource: El País (sp), Reforma (sp), El Universal (sp), Milenio (sp)',\n",

Only 18% of respondents said the López Obrador administration is doing a good job addressing the ongoing high levels of violence while 67% said the opposite.\\n\\nThe former figure fell from 20% in March and 26% in January while the latter increased from 61% last month and 57% at the start of the year.\\n\\nIn economic matters, 49% of respondents rated the government’s performance poorly while only 28% praised it. Hit hard by the coronavirus and associated economic restrictions, GDP slumped 8.5% in 2020 and the economy remained in recession in the first quarter of 2020, according to preliminary year-over-year numbers.\\n\\nDespite Mexico having the fourth highest Covid-19 death toll in the world, the government achieved its best poll result in the area of health, with 36% of respondents saying that it is doing a good job. However, a slightly higher percentage of those polled – 38% – said that the government is performing badly in the area.\\n\\nEven though the El Financiero/Bloomberg poll shows there is significant discontent with the government, the ruling Morena party and its allies remain on track to win a comprehensive victory in the June 6 Chamber of Deputies election, according to predictions based on the latest “poll of polls” collated by the website Oraculus.\\n\\nIt predicts that Morena will win 44%, or 220, of the 500 seats in the lower house of federal Congress and that its allies, the Labor Party (PT) and the Ecological Green Party of Mexico (PVEM), will each win around 9%, or 43 and 45, respectively.\\n\\nIf that occurs, the Morena-PT-PVEM alliance will win 308 of the 500 seats, 300 of which are elected directly and 200 by proportional representation. That would give the coalition a strong majority in the lower house but not the two-thirds majority needed to approve constitutional changes.\\n\\nMorena and its allies, which include the Social Encounter Party (PES), currently hold 334 lower house seats but Oraculus predicts that the PES – which currently occupies 20 seats – won’t win any seats at the June 6 election.\\n\\nOraculus predicts that the three-party coalition consisting of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), the National Action Party (PAN) and the Democratic Revolution Party (PRD) will win a combined 37% of seats.\\n\\nIt predicts that 14% will go to the PRI, 17% to the PAN and 6% to the PRD.

              " 'Girls as young as nine are being sold into marriage for as little as 40,000 pesos (US $2,005) in Guerrero’s poverty-stricken Montaña region.\\n\\nYoung girls are being sold to their future husbands for 40,000 to 200,000 pesos (US $10,030), according to a report by the newspaper Reforma, which described the sale of child brides as a form of 21st-century slavery.\\n\\nPart of the payment is sometimes made with cattle or even beer, Reforma said. The sale of young girls for marriage is a traditional practice in parts of Guerrero, especially in indigenous communities such as those found in the Mixtec municipality of Metlatónoc.\\n\\n“It’s an old practice that we can’t eradicate even though the law says that the practice is a crime, human trafficking, specifically,” Serafín Nava Ortiz, a Metlatónoc lawyer and advisor to the municipal trustee, said in 2017.\\n\\nThe police chief in the town of Yuvi’nani said in an interview with the newspaper El Universal the same year that he had bought young wives for his sons, including a 14-year-old girl for whom he paid 110,000 pesos.\\n\\nAsked where he got the money from, Melitón Hernández explained that he did pretty well as a migrant in the United States: “I brought about 300,000 pesos from there.”\\n\\nHe also joked that he had bought his own wife, saying flippantly that he paid “50 pesos about 55 years ago.”\\n\\nAccording to Martha Givaudan, head of Yo quiero Yo puedo (I want I can), a nongovernmental organization that works with disadvantaged communities, an estimated 300,000 girls have been sold into marriage in Guerrero over the years.\\n\\nHowever, she acknowledged that there are no exact figures because most sales of child brides and subsequent marriages are not reported to authorities. State and municipal governments in Guerrero are well aware of the practice but have done little to stop it.\\n\\nReforma spoke to several indigenous women who recounted their own experiences of being sold as brides when they were still girls or adolescents.\\n\\n“They put a price on you and they sell you without asking, without telling you,” said a woman identified only as Julia who was sold by her grandfather when she was 13. “You don’t have the option to say no,” she said.\\n\\nJulia, who left her husband after suffering beatings for years, said she received no help from authorities when she was trapped in an abusive marriage at a young age. She added that other child brides have experienced similar situations.\\n\\n“Nobody in the town helped us, not the municipality, not the state government, not the federal government,” Julia said.\\n\\n“[The traditional form of government known as] usos y costumbres supposedly protects [people], but in reality it allows the abuse of girls and women,” she said.\\n\\nMariana, who was also sold as a child bride, told Reforma that “a lot of girls are suffering.”\\n\\n“Social programs don’t reach our towns and even less so to help women,” she said.\\n\\n“… Why do the authorities allow the sale of girls to continue as though they were animals, seeking protection in the usos y costumbres?” Mariana said. “Drugs come in [to our towns] but not basic human rights.”\\n\\nAnother woman sold as a child bride criticized soldiers for not helping young girls who have had their childhood cut short by being forced to become wives and being put to work or to raise children.\\n\\n“The soldiers that arrive in town, why don’t they defend us? On the contrary, they take advantage of us as well and do us harm,” Ana said.\\n\\nGivaudan, the NGO chief, said girls are often forced to work by their buyers to pay off the “debt” they incurred.\\n\\n“It might be that a man decides to buy a girl [for himself] or purchases one for his son,” she said.\\n\\n“… In addition to the sexual exploitation that implies, … the girl goes to work in the home, making tortillas, making the food; she has to go out to plant crops and have children,” Givaudan said. “The whole traditional role [of a wife] is being imposed on girls when they should be in school.”\\n\\nShe also said that girls lives are also placed at risk because they often become pregnant before their bodies are ready.\\n\\nSome become pregnant just when they’re reaching puberty, Givaudan said. “… It puts the lives of girls at risk, … they become mothers too early.”\\n\\nGuerrero ranks second in the country for teenage pregnancies, Reforma said, adding that two of 10 births in the southern state are to mothers aged 19 or younger.\\n\\n“It’s not just a problem of gender,” Givaudan said, referring to the engrained practice of selling young girls as wives. “It’s also one of rights, poverty and health.”\\n\\nSource: Reforma (sp)',\n",

Among the victims were a high-ranking municipal government official, an independent political candidate and an activist.\\n\\nEl Universal reported that the CJNG announced its presence in strategic points in Baja California in a recent video posted to social media.\\n\\nIt also said that intelligence departments of local security forces have warned that the cartel — an extremely violent criminal group which the United States Drug Enforcement Administration says is the primary drug trafficking organization in 24 of Mexico’s 32 states — is using the municipal seat of Tecate, a Magical Town 50 kilometers east of Tijuana, as its operational base.\\n\\nThe CJNG is also believed to be responsible for recent attacks on rural fire stations in Tecate, forcing authorities to close all four. The criminal group also allegedly abducted an ambulance paramedic and forced him to treat the wounds of a hitman injured in a gunfight with a rival cartel.\\n\\nA fire chief in the town of Tecate told El Universal that a young firefighter in the community of La Rumorosa was captured and tied up by cartel members who stole his car to make a getaway before dumping it and setting it on fire. In addition, a fire engine was recently riddled with bullets by gunmen, leading firefighters to walk off their jobs.\\n\\n“Nobody could guarantee our security. How can I send young men to work like that?” the fire chief said.\\n\\nIt is unclear why the presumed CJNG members have been directly targeting firefighters. One possibility is that they wanted to scare off all authorities in the areas where they are seeking to operate with impunity.\\n\\nThe recent increase in violence in Tecate has interrupted years of tranquility enjoyed by residents, El Universal said. The newspaper also reported that a group dedicated to searching for missing people has been created in the border municipality for the first time.\\n\\nMadres Buscándote Tecate (Mothers Looking for You Tecate) found the remains of seven men and women in a single month on a track that runs along a local river, El Universal said.\\n\\nOne member of the group said that one of the other mothers was told she would be killed if she continued looking for bodies.\\n\\n“… I’m afraid. … I ask myself, how do … they know about the people we’re looking for, who gives them that information?” she said.\\n\\n• In other CJNG news, the bodies of three siblings who were abducted on Friday night were found Sunday in San Cristóbal de la Barranca, Jalisco, a municipality 60 kilometers north of Guadalajara.\\n\\nLuis Ángel González Moreno, 32, José Alberto González Moreno, 29, and Ana Karen González Moreno, 24, were kidnapped by armed men who broke into their Guadalajara home. According to witnesses, the criminals were hooded and wearing military attire emblazoned with the CJNG initials.\\n\\nThe siblings were forced into a pickup truck and nothing was known of their whereabouts until their bodies were found Sunday on the highway between San Cristóbal de la Barranca and Colotlán. Authorities have not revealed a motive for the abduction and murder.\\n\\nLuis Ángel was a musician and ran a screen-printing business, José Alberto was also a musician as well as a geography student at the University of Guadalajara while Ana Karen worked at an automotive company.\\n\\n• The CJNG is also believed responsible for an attack Monday morning in Chinicuila, Michoacán, a municipality in the state’s west that borders both Colima and Jalisco. El Universal reported that presumed cartel gunmen opened fire in the community of Villa Victoria. It also said that an explosive-laden drone came down on a home whose residents had earlier fled the violence.\\n\\nIn El Salitre, another community in Chinicuila, residents reported that criminals seized and set alight three vehicles to block a highway in order to aid their escape from federal and state security forces. Residents said that people were still inside the vehicles when they were set on fire.\\n\\nThe Michoacán government hasn’t reported any deaths or injuries in Chinicuila, which is part of the state’s coastal region.

              " 'Jocsan Avilés Díaz comes from a town called El Progreso — progress — but for him, it was anything but. Unemployment drove him out of Honduras in 2019, bound for the U.S. “I hadn’t had a job in years,” he explained, still stuck on the Mexican side of the border two years later.\\n\\nThe plight of people like Avilés has only cemented Central America’s reputation for poverty and hardship. He comes from the fringes of the “dry corridor” where drought, on top of violence, poverty and extortion, has driven tens of thousands of desperate families from the so-called Northern Triangle of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to try to enter the U.S. via Mexico.\\n\\nUnauthorized border crossings into the U.S. from Mexico have soared this year to near 20-year highs. This poses an acute political problem for President Joe Biden, who has asked Vice-President Kamala Harris to deal with the crisis and has earmarked US $4 billion in aid for the Northern Triangle. How this will be spent is not clear.\\n\\n“We want to help people find hope at home,” she told a regional conference this month as the U.S. focuses less on interdiction, as it did under Donald Trump, and more on financing development. “And so we are focused on addressing both the acute factors and the root causes of migration.”\\n\\nSince the end of the Central American civil wars in the 1980s, economic growth in the region has consistently fallen behind the rest of Latin America. Over the past 30 years, per capita gross domestic product growth averaged a paltry 1.2% per year in the Northern Triangle, according to the International Monetary Fund.\\n\\nA 2004 free trade agreement with the U.S., known as Cafta-DR, aimed at increasing access to the major North American market, and one with the European Union in 2012 were intended to boost trade. Exports from Central America did rise a modest 6% a year on average during 1991-2017.\\n\\nBut while Costa Rica and Panama, the region’s two outperformers, prospered on the back of eco-tourism and financial services respectively, gains in the Northern Triangle and Nicaragua have proved elusive.\\n\\n“Central America has Cafta but even so, it hasn’t managed to get ahead,” said Laura Chinchilla, who was involved in negotiations for the Dominican Republic-Central America-U.S. Free Trade Agreement and later, as president of Costa Rica, was a signatory of the regional EU trade deal.\\n\\n“For Costa Rica, Cafta meant a qualitative leap in exports and investment attraction. But not for Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.”\\n\\nThose four countries contain the bulk of the region’s population and just over half its GDP but are the four with the lowest income, according to the World Bank. They are blighted by corruption, impunity, gang violence and weak rule of law. Experts say their governments have invested far too little in education and infrastructure.\\n\\n“Governments in the region haven’t been able to generate the opportunities for people to become prosperous because they simply don’t have the development plans,” said Ricardo Castaneda, senior economist at the Central American Institute for Fiscal Studies, a think tank.\\n\\nAdvocates of Cafta hoped an increase in trade with the U.S. would deliver better jobs and wages following on from the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement that consolidated Mexico as a manufacturing hub even though it did not deliver nationwide development.\\n\\n“Cafta-DR hasn’t worked as intended for a variety of reasons: it was seen … as a way to guarantee access to the U.S. market rather than to integrate among themselves; it didn’t effectively mesh up with NAFTA … and during the negotiations, the U.S. restricted imports of a number of products where the region was highly competitive,” said Eric Farnsworth, vice-president of the Council of the Americas.\\n\\nIn fact, the U.S. appears to have benefited to a far greater extent than the Northern Triangle: U.S. goods exports to Guatemala in 2019 soared 140% compared with their pre-Cafta levels, whereas Guatemala’s exports to the U.S. rose just 27% in that period, official U.S. data shows. The rise in U.S. exports to Guatemala was more than three times higher than Guatemala’s exports to the U.S.\\n\\nHigher exports brought employment, but most of the jobs were low-productivity and low-paid and there were not enough to go round: more than 600,000 young people a year in the region chase just 250,000 new formal sector jobs, according to the UN.\\n\\nAs a result, “instead of being successful and exporting goods and services, like Costa Rica did, these countries have exported their citizens,” said Chinchilla.\\n\\n“Since around 2009, approximately 1% of the population of the Northern Triangle has gotten up and moved every year,” Ricardo Zúñiga, Biden’s special envoy for the Northern Triangle, told a recent Council of the Americas webinar. “There’s absolutely no chance we are going to be able to address … this longstanding problem unless we create jobs in Central America.”\\n\\nBut with the size of the working-age population set to drop sharply in Central America by 2035, the World Bank cautioned in a new report that countries will need to boost productivity and integrate into North American supply chains to ensure strong growth.\\n\\nFor many of the region’s companies, that is a tall order. Most are micro or small businesses without the capacity to compete. “It’s like they’re in a Formula One race but on a bike without both wheels,” said Castaneda.\\n\\nPoor governance is another problem. Zúñiga skipped Honduras on a recent trip to the Northern Triangle — a sign that President Juan Orlando Hernández, who has been named by U.S. prosecutors as an accomplice in drug trafficking, is “a leper,” said Pedro Barquero, head of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Cortés in Honduras. Hernández denies the allegations.\\n\\nIn El Salvador, Zúñiga was stood up by President Nayib Bukele, who is criticized for excessive authoritarianism.\\n\\n“In reality, free trade agreements won’t do any good if countries don’t put in the work,” Barquero said, noting that Honduras’ precipitous decline in Transparency International’s corruptions perception index in the past five years was matched by a plunge in its image as a place to do business.\\n\\nBiden hopes to tackle the causes of migration from Central America with a $4-billion aid package, but this will require long-term commitment from Washington, and success, if it comes, will take many years.\\n\\n“The reality is that the U.S. has had few, if any successes, at nation-building in Latin America or anywhere else, at least since the Marshall Plan,” said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington. “It is important to pose an uncomfortable question: where has the U.S. succeeded in what it is trying to do today in Central America?”\\n\\n© 2021 The Financial Times Ltd.

              " 'We foreigners know Mexico sort of from the “outside in” … the country which has a capital of the same name. But that is both simplistic and inaccurate.\\n\\nWhen I first came to Mexico, I lived in Toluca, a small city in the central part of the country. I quickly became confused and curious because locals referred to Mexico City simply as México and as residents of México state called themselves mexiquenses as well as mexicanos.\\n\\nMuch of the country calls Mexico City México without the Ciudad de part, but that is not true everywhere. In Mexicali, when I referred to Mexico City as México, I was strongly corrected: “Ciudad de México,” they said. “Mexicali is part of Mexico, too.”\\n\\nThe word México originates in the Mesoamerican era with the Náhuatl word Mēxihco (pronounced Meh-SHI-ko) originally referring to the Valley of México. A people called the Mexica migrated south from a place they called Aztlán, established a city on a marshy island in Lake Texcoco, then expanded their domain over the entire valley and beyond.\\n\\nThat valley came to be known as the land of the Mexica, or the Valley of México. The capital, Tenochtitlán, was called both Tenochtitlán and (the city of) Mexico.\\n\\nThe empire later came to be known as Aztec, a term coined by historian Alexander von Humboldt. Not all Aztecs were Mexica, although the terms today are often used interchangeably.\\n\\nThe 500th anniversary of the fall of the Aztec Empire is this year, specifically on August 13, commemorating the taking of Tenochtitlan by Hernán Cortés’ army of Spanish and (more importantly) indigenous allies. The Spanish simply substituted themselves as the heads of the old Aztec social order.\\n\\nBut Tenochtitlán is difficult for Spanish speakers to pronounce, so México was adopted with a pronunciation change to fit Spanish phonetics.\\n\\nWhen New Spain was created, it was divided into five provinces, the most important of which was — you guessed it — México, based roughly off the borders of the old Aztec Empire. Mexico City became the capital of both the province and the colony of New Spain.\\n\\nSo during the colonial period, México could refer to Mexico City, the valley in which it is located or the colonial-era province.\\n\\nIn the early 19th century, New Spain fought for and gained independence from Spain. One reason the rebellion succeeded was a shift in identity among those of European heritage born in the colony.\\n\\nUnder the social order, those born in New Spain were second in status to peninsulares (those born in Spain), yet they felt that they were the “true Mexicans.” For this reason, when independence was achieved in 1821, the choice of name for the new country was Mexico.\\n\\nThis did not change the name of the city, valley or province. During the 19th century, the colonial Mexico province was a state, a département or a province, depending on which of the constantly warring forces were in control of the country at the time.\\n\\nBut shortly after independence, there began a process of breaking up these lands. The first was separating out Mexico City proper with the adoption of the 1824 constitution. Similar to Washington, D.C., the idea was that the capital was of the entire country, not just one part of it.\\n\\nThe city would remain under direct control of the federal government until 2016.\\n\\nThe remaining Aztec lands were called the state or province of Mexico. For various socioeconomic and political reasons, these vast lands were eventually divided into various entities, the core of which are Morelos, Guerrero, Hidalgo and México state.\\n\\nThe first three are named after Independence War heroes, and the rest is the Valley of Toluca, with a curious panhandle that almost completely surrounds Mexico City. That panhandle is the result of the expansion of the territory of the federal district of Mexico City after the Mexican-American War.\\n\\nThere have been a number of official name changes to the country since independence, but all refer to Mexico in some way. With the current constitution, adopted in 1917, the official name became the Estados Unidos Mexicanos or United Mexican States.\\n\\nColloquially, the country is referred to as the República Mexicana (Mexican Republic), or simply México, in part because the official name sounds too much like that of the country’s northern neighbor.\\n\\nAs if all this was not confusing enough, in 2016 Mexico City was recategorized from being a federal district to a state.\\n\\nThat is right — México state is a state, and Mexico City is a state too. If I had to bet, my money would be on México state changing its name at some point to Toluca to end the confusion. The panhandle might even get absorbed into Mexico City.\\n\\nThe use of México reflects that the identity of the country is still highly tied with the city and is reinforced by history, legends and symbols such as the eagle and cactus (from the Aztec origin myth) and the Virgin of Guadalupe.\\n\\nHowever, that identity has not been absolute. It weakens as you get farther away from the lands identified as Mesoamerica (Aztec and other pre-Hispanic empires). For this reason, the countries of Central America broke away shortly after independence and the United States was able to keep Texas and the southwest after the Mexican-American War.\\n\\nMexico almost lost Yucatán and Chiapas as well.\\n\\nIn northern Mexico, the idea of being Mexican is complicated both because of influence from the United States in the north and a cultural and political rivalry with the seat of power to the south.\\n\\nIf you live anywhere in Mexico, it is worthwhile to visit Mexico City at least once to get a feel for it as the ombligo del mundo (the navel of the world). It is a Mexican’s point of reference, economically, politically and culturally, even if the Mexican in question hates it …\\n\\nLeigh Thelmadatter arrived in Mexico 18 years ago and fell in love with the land and the culture in particular its handcrafts and art.

              " 'San Juanito Escobedo is perhaps the archetype of the quiet unassuming, forgotten pueblito located in the middle of nowhere.\\n\\nThat “nowhere” just happens to be within the bounds of what was once Mexico’s third-largest lake, La Laguna de Magdalena, which was drained in 1936 to create great stretches of flat, arable land.\\n\\nThis being the case, I was surprised indeed to receive the following message from my friend Rick Echeverría.\\n\\n“John, have you visited the big distillery in San Juanito? If you do, don’t miss their tequila-aging cava — it may be the biggest in the world.”\\n\\nI soon learned that the distillery is called Agave Azul, and I was kindly invited to tour the place by members of the García family, which runs the business.\\n\\nAgave Azul and San Juanito are located 60 kilometers west of Guadalajara. Google Maps took my friends and me right there but via a truly adventurous route, including dirt roads and back streets that tested the mettle of our four-wheel-drive vehicle.\\n\\nBut after bouncing over the last pothole of a rut-ridden back alley, we suddenly arrived in front of a huge, modern industrial complex, and there we met José de Jesús García García, owner of Agave Azul.\\n\\n“Our aim,” Señor García told me,” is to preserve the traditional way of making tequila, using stonework ovens and stills, the historical approach.” He added that many distilleries buy their agaves from others, but not his.\\n\\n“Just look out the window and you can see hills covered with our agaves azules [blue agaves], 500 hectares of them, to be exact.”\\n\\nGarcía then surprised me by announcing that all those agaves are organic.\\n\\n“We fertilize them with compost made from our own waste products, from our own bagasse [in this case, the shredded fibers of the agave hearts]. So we are returning to the soil what we have taken out of it, and we are not contaminating. Instead of killing the land around us, we are enriching it, we are making it more productive.”\\n\\nJosé García then launched into the story of how this tequilería came into being, and quite a story it is.\\n\\n” I am the great-grandson of Don Anselmo García. I didn’t know him because I was born in 1957, a few years after he died, but he was a craftsman. He produced and sold all sorts of artesanías made from tule, the reed that used to grow all around the edge of the Laguna de Magdalena.\\n\\n“He made petates [sleeping mats] and sopladoras [hand fans for stoves and fireplaces] and curious-looking chinas that served as raincoats in bygone times. Don Anselmo would travel all around this area, selling his products of tule along with queso enchilado, which is so called because the outside of this cheese is literally covered with chile for two reasons: first to make sure flies don’t land on it, and second to preserve its correct consistency. This procedure, in fact, preserves the cheese for over a year.\\n\\n“Now, one day, when my great-grandpa was in Tequila, Don Javier Sauza said to him: ‘Why don’t you plant agaves in your pueblo?’ And it was because of him that agaves were introduced to San Juanito.\\n\\n“So my bisabuelo [great-grandfather] brought someone here to show people how to plant and cultivate and harvest agaves. Years later, when the first of them were ready for harvest, they set up what we traditionally call a taberna here, with distilling equipment made of copper.\\n\\n“But all of this was for friends, and they didn’t call it tequila; they called it aguardiente [firewater]. Then my great-grandfather died, and that was the end of the taberna.”\\n\\nJosé García told me that friends of the family eventually revived the taberna and even got him involved in the project, but he never knew that the distillery had anything to do with his great-grandfather “until one day, I ran into my great-uncle and I said: ‘Uncle, why don’t we have a little drink?’ And he replied, ‘But where can we go?’\\n\\n“‘To the tequila factory,’ I answered.\\n\\n“‘What factory? You’re crazy.’\\n\\nSo they got into a truck and headed along a little dirt road in the middle of nowhere.\\n\\n“… my great-uncle says, ‘Isn’t this Los Reyes?’”\\n\\nWhen García replied that it was, the great-uncle said, “Bueno, Los Reyes is the place where my father used to make a really good aguardiente.”\\n\\n“And that is when I put it all together,” García explained. “I understood that this distillery where I was helping out was, in fact, the very same [one] my great-grandfather had set up years ago. That is when I decided to take up what my great-grandfather had been doing and to make it my own. Now, finally, we are completing the obra [life’s work] that he began a long, long time ago.”\\n\\nAfter hearing this story, we went on a tour of the distillery, following the process whereby the piñas de agave are cooked in a huge stone oven, crushed and squeezed dry. Then the juice goes into fermenting vats, followed by distillation in huge alambiques, or stills.\\n\\nAll these works are built on a hillside to take advantage of gravity, with the final product ending up in their cava. There it is aged in oak barrels from France and the United States for up to three years.\\n\\nThis cava — which is accessed via a long, spooky passageway right out of Edgar Allan Poe’s The Cask of Amontillado — is a huge underground room that provides the perfect temperature (10 to 13 C) and conditions for aging.\\n\\nIn other distilleries, over 10% of a barrel of tequila is lost to evaporation every year, but deep underground, this phenomenon is greatly reduced.\\n\\nAfter touring the distillery, we went off to the composting facility located five minutes away. Here, in front of row after row of composting beds, we met Luis Ángel Ruvalcaba, who explained how Agave Azul makes its own fertilizer.\\n\\nMost other tequila makers throw away their bagasse and their distillation slops (the top and bottom portions of the fermented must or wort).

              " 'Five hundred years ago, Hernán Cortés was marching from Tlaxcala on his way to the final defeat of the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan. Because the role of Tlaxcala in the story of the Conquest is absolutely pivotal, the state has an awkward place in the culture of modern Mexico.\\n\\nToday, Tlaxcala is Mexico’s smallest state, living in the shadows of its much larger neighbors, Mexico City and Puebla. From the pre-Hispanic to the modern period, it has a long history of fighting to remain a distinct entity.\\n\\nThis struggle is behind its role in the Conquest. Cortés did not achieve this feat with a few hundred soldiers, some horses and firearms. He sized up the political situation in Mesoamerica and took advantage of the Aztecs’ Achilles heel: how much they were hated by their neighbors.\\n\\nHe started by allying himself with the peoples on the Veracruz coast. After learning of Tlaxcala’s long struggle to remain independent of the sprawling Aztec Empire, he went there with his new expanded forces.\\n\\nDespite its proximity, Tlaxcala had not been taken over by the Aztecs, at the price of constant warfare and a trade embargo that crippled the economy. Simply put, the Tlaxcalans had more than enough reason to want the Aztec Empire wiped out.\\n\\nThat did not mean they ran to join Cortés. When the Spanish reached the Tlaxcala border, they sent emissaries to ask permission to enter and meet with the Tlaxcalan lords. They received no answer.\\n\\nCortés entered anyway, sparking a series of battles that demonstrated the power that the Spanish had and convinced the Tlaxcalans to negotiate.\\n\\nIt was not an easy position for them to be in. On the one hand, you have a rival empire that is wearing you down, and on the other, you are confronted by a people you know nothing about and who has technology way beyond yours. It may simply have been a question of “Which was the lesser evil?”\\n\\nFor Cortés, an alliance with the Tlaxcalans was crucial. It would give him a base from which to attack the heart of the Aztec Empire. Tlaxcala not only knew the enemy well but was still a formidable power in its own right.\\n\\nA treaty was worked out. At its most basic, it allowed Tlaxcala to maintain a separate identity in the coming colonial order, but they did have to pledge allegiance to the Spanish king and accept Catholicism.\\n\\nThey were also promised privileges that other indigenous peoples would not have, including keeping their names. This is why if you come across a Mexican with a Náhuatl family name (e.g. Desiderio H. Xochitziotzin), they have Tlaxcalan heritage.\\n\\nAfter securing the alliance, Cortés set out for Tenochtitlán to meet Moctezuma. That round ended with the Night of Sorrows (La Noche Triste). Cortés and his men were routed from the city by its residents, who also murdered their emperor.\\n\\nWhat was left of the Spanish and their allies limped back to Tlaxcala in the summer of 1520. Cortés did not really know what the reception would be. Not all of the Tlaxcalan leaders were amenable to the alliance with the Spanish, and now Cortés showed that he was not invincible.\\n\\nIn addition, the new Aztec emperor, Cuitláhuac, opened diplomatic channels, offering to end the trade embargo if the Tlaxcalans would sever their ties to the Spanish and join them. It was debated by the Tlaxcalan leadership. Had they accepted, it would have been the end of Cortés.\\n\\nBut they remained with the Spanish, mostly likely due to their burning hatred of the Aztecs. They probably didn’t trust the Aztecs to keep their word either.\\n\\nAfter licking his wounds and reaffirming his alliance with Tlaxcala, Cortés was able to leave again for Tenochtitlán on December 28, 1520, accompanied by Tlaxcalan warriors. Tenochitlán fell on August 13, 1521.\\n\\nTlaxcala’s strategic importance bought it pledges from Cortés. However, the Spanish were not all that good at keeping their promises either.\\n\\nThe Tlaxcalans had to fight to get colonial authorities to recognize their rights on various occasions, including direct appeals to the Spanish Crown. One of these appeals resulted in the Tlaxcala Codex, which documents the alliance from the Tlaxcalans’ perspective.\\n\\nBefore the 20th century, it was these privileges, along with roles that Tlaxcalans played in expanding New Spain both northward and southward that caused much of the resentment against them.\\n\\nThe idea of the Tlaxcalans as traitors came with modern ideas of indigenous identity, basically placing the state and its residents in the same category of La Malinche, Cortés’ indigenous interpreter.\\n\\nBut the truth is that there was no “pan-indigenous” identity before the arrival of the Europeans, no more than there was a pan-European identity. Like everywhere else, Mesoamerican peoples had conflicts among themselves that defined their world.\\n\\nOver the centuries, Tlaxcala lost its privileges and even almost disappeared. After independence, it was once integrated with Puebla and once with the province of Mexico (which included México state and Mexico City).\\n\\nBut efforts to regain separate status were successful, and it is now one of the sovereign states of the Mexican Republic — politically secure, but not so much culturally.\\n\\nThere are jokes and internet memes stating that the state does not really exist because it is easy to overlook geographically and with such major cities nearby. Like Puebla, Toluca, Querétaro and Cuernavaca, it is close enough to the capital to be part of the growing megalopolis, but rapid growth has come here only recently.\\n\\nThough not as strong as in the recent past, the moniker of “traitor” still creates a stigma that is difficult to live with, says University of Tlaxcala anthropologist Juan Carlos Ramos.\\n\\nLeigh Thelmadatter arrived in Mexico 18 years ago and fell in love with the land and the culture in particular its handcrafts and art.

              " '“Probably nowhere in the world do two countries as different as Mexico and the United States live side by side.” — Alan Riding, Distant Neighbors, 1985\\n\\nIt is difficult to imagine in the modern history of Mexico and the United States two presidents as dissimilar as Andrés Manuel López Obrador and Joseph R. Biden. Their visions of their countries’ present and future could not be more different. This becomes crystal clear when examining their agendas and priorities.\\n\\nPerhaps one of the few things these two men have in common is their political persistence: three times, both made presidential bids, and both were elected on their third try.\\n\\nThese two heads of state not only differ in substance but also in their ways. Throughout the three decades of his political life, Mr. López Obrador has been a polarizing figure, well-known for being both strident and divisive.\\n\\nOn the other hand, in 50 years of public service as a senator and as vice president to Barack Obama, Mr. Biden has proven to be a sensible and empathic politician, a master of compromise renowned for his soft skills.\\n\\nNotwithstanding the different strengths and challenges facing Mexico and the U.S., there are substantive issues on which the two presidents differ, completely or in part, and which may largely define the sort of relationship that the two countries will have in the remaining four years of both presidents’ administrations.\\n\\nIssues around immigration, drug trafficking, trade, the role of the private sector, their nations’ international responsibilities and the role of independent institutions, particularly those in a position to challenge government excesses — such as autonomous bodies, not-for-profit organizations and the media.\\n\\nDivergences between the two presidents may be most starkly revealed by how they are addressing three prominent issues: the Covid-19 pandemic and ensuing economic fallout, science and transparency and the environment and climate change.\\n\\nAmid the worst pandemic humanity has suffered through in a century, the human lives lost and the impact on financial systems in both the United States and Mexico have been devastating. Of the more than 3.2 million deaths worldwide due to Covid-19, nearly 600,000 have been in the U.S. and nearly 218,000 in Mexico — although the López Obrador administration recently admitted that, as of last March, there were actually 321,000 deaths in Mexico. Some estimates put the total figure closer to a 600,000.\\n\\nClearly distancing himself from the incompetent and shameful way his predecessor handled the pandemic, Mr. Biden boosted coronavirus testing, promoted the use of face masks and made decisions based on scientific evidence. In Biden’s first 100 days, his administration delivered 220 million vaccine shots.\\n\\nAs a result, today, 70% of Americans 65 years and older have been vaccinated, over half of all adults have gotten at least one jab and anybody older than 16 can be vaccinated.\\n\\nThe U.S. government also provided financial support to states, municipalities, small businesses and families all over the country — in fact, 85% of American households have already received cash assistance, and small businesses have been offered loans to reopen and avoid losing employees.\\n\\nIn contrast, the situation in Mexico could not be more different, nor more tragic. From the beginning, the government downplayed the pandemic, denied or ignored the scientific evidence of its seriousness and failed to substantially augment the number of tests, while the use of face masks was disincentivized.\\n\\nAnd the economic support to those in need and to small businesses suffering from the crisis has been appallingly small. As of May 3, only around 12 million people have been vaccinated (Mexico’s population is 126 million) and 13 million jabs of the vaccine had been delivered, counting both first and second doses.\\n\\nMr. Biden reasserted his commitment to listening to science and to ensuring that decisions on public policies dealing with health, environment, climate change, etc. are communicated to people by trusted experts. He further pledged to boost trust, transparency and accountability on government actions and proposed to nearly triple U.S. science spending in the 2022 federal budget, raising it from 0.7% of GDP to close to 2%.\\n\\nIn contrast, during his administration’s first two years, Mr. López Obrador has devoted a good deal of time and energy to discrediting both science and scientists. In 2020, his government and his Morena party, which has a majority in Congress, extinguished 109 trusts, including those for international cooperation on science and technology, technological innovation, natural disasters, climate change and scientific and environmental research for education.\\n\\nMexico’s 2021 budget to support science, technology and innovation amounts to the equivalent of US $5.1 billion (just 0.38% of Mexico’s GDP). Of those funds, $1.3 billion were allocated to the National Council of Science and Technology (Conacyt), an institution established 50 years ago that is largely responsible for many of Mexico’s key scientific advances but now has lost the trust of many scientists and is languishing, isolated and politicized.\\n\\nOn the environment, President Biden has ordered a pause on licensing to exploit oil and gas on public lands and established an office for environmental justice at the White House. He has also pledged to protect 30% of U.S. land and coastal seas by 2030.\\n\\nOn April 22, at the Leaders Summit on Climate Change in Washington, D.C., Mr. Biden committed the U.S. to a reduction in greenhouse gases by at least 50% by 2030 — more than double the U.S. commitment in the 2015 Paris Agreement.\\n\\nFurthermore, Biden proposed to Congress a federal investment of $1.7 trillion for work on climate and environmental justice over the next 10 years and a package of $2 trillion for infrastructure that supports the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy together with the promise to foster thousands of new green jobs.\\n\\nAfter two years of his administration, it has become clear that the environment is not a priority for President López Obrador. The main federal environmental agencies (for biodiversity, forest, water and natural protected areas, as well as the climate change institute and the attorney general for environmental protection) have been all but dismantled.\\n\\nThe meager funds allocated to these agencies in 2021 are clear evidence of a lack of interest in environmental and climate change issues.\\n\\nFor example, while the highly distrusted Sembrando Vida (Sowing Life) federal program — which has the declared goal of reforesting 1 million hectares — was granted $1.4 billion, the Natural Protected Areas Commission (Conanp), the agency responsible for conserving biodiversity and environmental services on 91 million hectares of land and at sea across the country, received only $43.3 million, despite the fact that the bulk of Mexico’s amazing biodiversity occurs in areas that Conanp must oversee and protect.\\n\\nMr. López Obrador has favored his mammoth pet projects, all of which have been criticized by independent scientists for the huge environmental and social damages they could cause. These include the so-called Maya Train, which received $1.5 billion from the 2021 federal budget, and the building of the Dos Bocas oil refinery located in the president’s home state of Tabasco, to which $2.25 billion was allocated.\\n\\nIn fact, 11.6% of Mexico’s total budget passed by Congress in 2021 will go to fossil fuel production, and only 1.1% will be invested in climate change mitigation and adaptation — and 75% of that will go to natural gas transport, an activity that generates the same gases that warm the planet.\\n\\nIf nothing changes, Mexico will certainly miss its commitments as part of the Paris Agreement, which include reducing greenhouse gases by 22% and black carbon by 51%, reaching a peak in emissions in 2026 and reducing emissions thereafter and producing 35% of its energy from clean sources by 2024 and 43% by 2030.\\n\\nThere is still time for the government of Mexico to change course on the way it deals with the environment, but even being the optimists we are, we know that time is not on our side. There is, however, hope.\\n\\nIn the midterm national elections, taking place on June 6, perhaps most Mexicans will decide to vote for those candidates committed to taking care of their country’s immense natural resources — for their own benefit and for the benefit of their children.\\n\\nWe choose to believe that Presidents López Obrador and Biden will somehow succeed in overcoming their differences, at least on the environment, climate change and the pivotal role that science and scientists play in the prosperity of the two countries. At a time when humanity is confronting unprecedented health, economic, social and political challenges, a strong Mexico-U.S. partnership in these crucial areas would be a powerful message to their own citizens and to the world.\\n\\nA message that even neighbors as dissimilar as we are can join forces for the common good.\\n\\nOmar Vidal, a scientist, was a university professor in Mexico, a former senior officer at the UN Environment Program and a former director-general of the World Wildlife Fund-México.\\n\\nRichard C.

              " 'The year is 1983. Surrounded by a small menagerie of injured rare wild animals, Sharon Matola has a decision to make.\\n\\nThe animals in her charge are unable to take care of themselves in the wild, and they are in the middle of the Mexico-Belize tropical forest with no real access to help or provisions.\\n\\nAfter stints as a Mexican circus performer, jungle-trained member of the air force and a wildlife documentary filmmaker, Matola “was at a crossroads,” she was to tell the Washington Post later of that moment.\\n\\n“I either had to shoot the animals or take care of them because they couldn’t take care of themselves in the wild.”\\n\\nThere and then she made the decision that was to shape the rest of her life until her sad and untimely death of a sudden heart attack on March 21 at the age of 66.\\n\\nThese days, Matola’s life has rightly become legend, but this was not something she could know as she was constructing rudimentary shelters for a veritable ark of animals on a shoestring budget in the early 1980s.\\n\\nBut, whatever the obstacles, onward Matola drove, displaying the signature never-say-die attitude that was to mark her next 40 years caring for animals and advocating aggressively for the protection of the Mexico–Belize jungle — the largest contiguous tropical forest in the Americas outside of the Amazon.\\n\\nBack then, at the very beginning, it started with nothing more than a pitched sign announcing the arrival of the “Belize Zoo,” later evolving into the Belize Zoo and Tropical Education Center.\\n\\nInitially charging a nominal entry fee and relying on local restaurants to send bored patrons her way, Belize Zoo struggled in its early years, raising chickens to supplement costs. Four decades after its inception, however, the sanctuary is one of Belize’s biggest tourist attractions: before the coronavirus pandemic wreaked havoc on tourism across the globe, the zoo hosted 75,000 visitors a year.\\n\\nCrucially, half of these visitors were Belizean. The center is, in great part, credited with having awoken an environmental consciousness in the nation.\\n\\nMarkedly different than your average controversial zoo, at Belize Zoo, animals were rehabilitated and remained in their natural habitats rather than locked up in small pens. Today, there are now more than 45 species at the zoo, including the emblematic tapir, coatimundis, and white-lipped peccaries — all keystone species in Mexico’s southern jungle.\\n\\nHer greatest work, however, was in her activism, which straddled Mexico and Belize and which awoke in her the greatest passions when defending the wildlife of the Maya Forest Corridor. She famously never suffered fools gladly and would happily take offending businessmen and politicians to task in very public settings.\\n\\nOne of her biggest fights in the early days was to spearhead a grueling five-year campaign against the construction of the Chalilo Dam on the Macal River.\\n\\nA landmark movement, it was the first environmental case to appear before the Court of Appeal of Belize, where Matola argued that building the dam would destroy animal habitats in the heart of the Maya forest corridor running through part of Belize, northern Guatemala, and southern Mexico.\\n\\nThe ecosystem is scientifically recognized as one of the world’s most important ecological systems and is home to rare species such as the scarlet macaw, a bird for which Matola was internationally recognized as a leading researcher.\\n\\nMuch to Matola’s disappointment, the attempt to reverse the building permission was unsuccessful, and the dam was constructed in 2005. Moreover, and likely to her even greater chagrin, she was right about the negative impact of the dam on the Selva Maya, where the pressures of modernization are already being felt by declining wildlife levels.\\n\\nHowever, while Matola’s attempt to combat the building of the dam may not have had the success she had hoped for, and won her more than a few enemies, her legacy nonetheless remains vitally important to the southern jungle and the people of Belize — a people she was to call her own when she took nationality in 1990.\\n\\nMatola’s resourcefulness and ability to make do with the bare minimum extended into all facets of her life: the rough-hewn wooden hut in which she lived at the zoo contained only the essentials for survival, and she shared her bathing pool with a crocodile.\\n\\nLikewise, at a conference in Miami in 1984, Matola — having no money for expenses but an abundance of determination — put an out of order sign on a toilet door and operated from there, walking around with a photo album to speak to anyone who would listen.\\n\\nThough Matola’s legacy, and the impact of her loss, will be most felt in her home in Belize, it will also be felt across the natural spaces of southern Mexico and Central America. The Selva Maya ecological corridor, to which Matola dedicated years and years of her life protecting, is under a greater threat than ever before: increasing global temperatures, deforestation and the encroachment of huge development projects such as the Maya Train are threatening huge swathes of land that will be irrecoverable once lost.\\n\\nWhere nature is concerned, there are no borders. The great, unique body of life which is our home exists as a single, interconnected entity, and it needs its defenders now more than ever. Last month, with the untimely death of Sharon Matola, nature took a hit.\\n\\nShannon Collins is an environment correspondent at Ninth Wave Global, an environmental organization and think tank.

              " 'In the “before-times” I frequently flew home to Texas for visits with my family and friends there. Though the Veracruz airport is closer to me, it’s much smaller, and I usually found better deals out of the Mexico City airport.\\n\\nSo, I would simply take a bus to the capital and fly out. It’s about a 4 1/2-hour ride, but the buses are nice (with bathrooms!), and my distracted brain was pretty much made for staring out the window and listening to music for hours on end.\\n\\nI’ve probably flown in and out of the Mexico City airport at least 100 times and you’d think I’d have a handle on the layout by now.\\n\\nBut no! I pretty much get lost or at least turned around every time.\\n\\nPart of the issue is a lack of signs. Some signs are clear and logical, as they should be, while others are simply absent. Also, if there’s an arrow pointing up, does that mean I go straight or that I go up the escalators right by me?\\n\\nI usually walk up and down the ground floor of Terminal 1 several times before I figure out where I’m supposed to go for ticketing. Every time I’ve picked someone up, I’m invariably at the wrong gate.\\n\\nKnowing whether I’m leaving from Terminal 1 or the relatively new Terminal 2 is also usually a mystery that I have to go to great length to figure out. Many airlines have check-in desks at both terminals, and while most international flights leave Terminal 2, they don’t always.\\n\\nIt’s an adventure before the real adventure gets started, and I make a point of getting there early so that I can be ready for whatever new obstacle is thrown at me. Usually, it’s simply a matter of having to take the fun speedy train thing to the other terminal (which you can only do if you have your ticket in hand; what happens if you’ve gone to pick someone up and you’re at the wrong terminal, I wonder).\\n\\nOther times, it’s the challenge of finding the tiny Autobuses de Oriente (ADO) ticketing agent tucked away in some far-off corner that is kilometers from where you actually board the bus and then finding the actual terminal from which the buses leave. The long skywalk to the terminal is mysteriously without any signage at all, and there are two skywalks not too far away from each other whose entrances are identical.\\n\\nWhen I arrive, I usually ask myself how the other people there managed to find it. I suppose they just asked someone like I always have to do.\\n\\nBuses don’t leave from there to Xalapa very often, however, so about 50% of the time, I walk the approximately half mile back to Gate 5 (or was it 6? … 7, maybe?) to buy a card for the Metro Bus, which is very nice and very cheap but also very hard to figure out. Without knowing exactly how much it will cost — why put a list of prices to common destinations? — I put about 100 pesos on the card, which up to now has always been enough.\\n\\nThen I go outside and stand in line, waiting for said Metro Bus (it’s like a fancy trolley — it gets its own lane!). Several come; it’s not always clear which one I need to be on, though, so I ask each driver.\\n\\nIt’s all a very complicated process, especially with heavy luggage and sometimes a child in tow. Rather than feeling frustrated, however, I feel proud of my ability to have once again navigated that labyrinth.\\n\\nI wonder, though: what do people who need to move around like this do, especially if they don’t speak Spanish? And even if you do speak Spanish, there are just so many little things you need to know … like what the Metro Bus even is, for example.\\n\\nBut all that being said, the Metro Bus is great — a big, clean, trolley that goes around certain key parts of Mexico City speedily. It was instituted by President López Obrador when he was the mayor of Mexico City.\\n\\nDuring the last presidential race, I’d often bring up the Metro Bus as a fantastic example of what good, logical government can do. In addition to it being fast, clean and inexpensive, it has cameras on each unit as well as a security officer who will usually help you with your bags if you have many. The stops themselves are also beautiful and orderly.\\n\\nI never would have guessed that that same person responsible for that wonder of posh infrastructure would later be responsible for canceling the beautiful new airport I’d been so looking forward to using.\\n\\nAs you might have read, the never-to-be airport just won an international architectural prize (the organizers apparently hadn’t realized that the project had been canceled). Our president, however, made a show of how unimpressed he was by the award and called the cancellation “the best public business we’ve done.”\\n\\nThis puzzles me because I don’t quite understand what his definition of “to do business” is. Is the cancellation of something not literally the opposite of “doing business”?\\n\\nMuch of his argument was that the new airport was over budget. Fair enough. But was there truly not a way to simply audit the expenses and look for ways to safely reduce additional costs? Was tossing the whole project really necessary?\\n\\nStill on the table, of course, and pushing forward despite several distinct objections from various environmental and local groups, is the Maya Train project. I’ll say one thing for the president: he really sticks to his decisions once they’re made.\\n\\nIn the meantime, I guess we’ll all just keep wandering laps around the Mexico City airport, hoping to get to our flights on time.\\n\\nIt’s no sparkling, award-winning architectural marvel, but at least it’s got coffee shops everywhere.\\n\\nSarah DeVries is a writer and translator based in Xalapa, Veracruz.

              " 'The navy will be given control of the new Isthmus of Tehuantepec trade corridor once it is completed, President López Obrador said Sunday.\\n\\nThe federal government is currently modernizing the 300-kilometer corridor between Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, on the Gulf of Mexico coast and Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, on Mexico’s Pacific side. The project, slated for completion in 2022, includes upgrades to the ports in both cities, construction of a new trans-isthmus highway and 10 industrial parks and modernization of the railroad between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.\\n\\nIn a video message filmed in Salina Cruz, López Obrador said that concessions to operate the new trade corridor will not be awarded to private or foreign companies.\\n\\n“It’s a matter of sovereignty, it will be managed by the state and looked after by the Ministry of the Navy,” the president said.\\n\\n“It’s to the navy that we’re going to entrust all these public works when we finish them, for the good and for the progress of our country,” López Obrador said.\\n\\nManagement of the trade corridor will add to the long list of tasks already entrusted to the military in Mexico. López Obrador has perpetuated the militarization of public security, even though he pledged to remove soldiers and marines from the streets, assigned the construction of major infrastructure projects, including the new Mexico City airport, to the army and put the military in charge of the nation’s ports and customs offices.\\n\\nThe military is also playing a role in the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines, nurturing saplings for the government’s tree-planting employment program and delivering textbooks, among other nontraditional tasks.\\n\\nThe president has defended his heavy reliance on the armed forces, casting the military as an honest institution and an essential ally in the fight against corruption.\\n\\nOn Sunday, López Obrador touted a navy-managed trade corridor as a vehicle for development and “progress with justice.”\\n\\nIt will generate jobs and well-being, he said, adding that the government is fully funding the 4.6-billion-peso (US $231.2 million) project without taking on debt. That is possible, the president explained, because his government has generated savings through its austerity program and elimination of corruption.\\n\\n“… How do we have money? … Because there’s no corruption, that’s the key to everything, … we’re saving; there are no luxuries in the government. Before there was a rich government with a poor people, the government was self-absorbed, it didn’t attend to the development of the country,” López Obrador said.\\n\\nA previous trans-isthmus project undertaken by the government of late 19th- and early 20th-century president Porfirio Diáz wasn’t as successful as expected because Pacific Rim countries, especially Asian nations, weren’t as economically important as they are today, he said.\\n\\n“Now it’s different,” López Obrador said. “The Pacific ports — not those on the Gulf [of Mexico], on the Atlantic — are the ones that move the most cargo by ships.

As a result, salaries in Mexico now rank as the lowest among the 37 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\\n\\nAlthough the USMCA enshrines workers’ right to independent representation and gives them more power to negotiate higher wages — a provision also designed to stem the loss of U.S. jobs to Mexico due to the lower wages paid here — hundreds of Tridonex employees were effectively blocked from joining the union of their choice.\\n\\nThe workers, unhappy with its current representation by the SITPME union because it didn’t support their fight for higher wages in 2019, sought to be represented by a new labor organization led by lawyer and activist Susana Prieto.\\n\\nBut state labor officials never scheduled an election, Reuters reported, adding that Prieto claimed that 600 of her supporters at Tridonex — a subsidiary of Philadelphia-based Cardone Industries, which is controlled by Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management — were fired last year “in what some workers described as retaliation for their efforts to switch unions.”\\n\\nThe AFL-CIO’s petition — supported by the union that represents U.S.-based Cardone workers, Prieto’s union and the U.S. nonprofit Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch — will put the USMCA’s labor enforcement provisions to the test for the first time, a case that will be closely watched by companies bound by the pact as well as labor activists.\\n\\nAccording to the trade agreement’s “Rapid Response Mechanism,” firms can be sanctioned with tariffs or other penalties if they don’t guarantee workers’ rights such as the freedom to choose their union.\\n\\nCathy Feingold, director of the international department of the AFL-CIO, which fought for the inclusion of improved workers’ rights provisions in the USMCA, said the Tridonex case will be precedent-setting and a test for the new system created by the new three-way trade agreement.\\n\\nThe AFL-CIO’s petition will go to the U.S. Office of Trade and Labor Affairs, which will have 30 days to review it and determine whether to take the case to the Mexican government.\\n\\nIf it decides to do so, labor officials in Mexico would collaborate with their counterparts in the United States to come to an agreement on terms of remediation, according to Reuters. The news agency said the entire process, which would include a final stage to determine potential sanctions on Tridonex and penalty fees, must be resolved in no more than five months.\\n\\nBenjamin Davis, director of international affairs for the United Steelworkers, which is part of the AFL-CIO, said most of the issues “could get fixed pretty quickly if the political will is there.”\\n\\nBefore the USMCA was ratified by the three North American trade partners, President López Obrador, who has pledged to get rid of “protection contracts” that are common in Mexico and seen by critics as favoring company interests over workers’ rights, promulgated a labor reform package that sought to give greater rights to company employees, democratize unions and give them more power to negotiate more effectively on behalf of their members.\\n\\nBut the 2019 reform is being implemented gradually and will not reach Tamaulipas — and the Matamoros Tridonex workers — until next year, Reuters said.\\n\\nDavis said that Mexico has a responsibility to ensure that the reform doesn’t remain on paper but is implemented on the ground.\\n\\n“The rights start right away, even if institutions aren’t in place yet,” he said.\\n\\nSource: Reuters (en)',\n",

A 12-year-old boy who was shot while playing video games with his brother to celebrate Children’s Day remained hospitalized on Saturday, the news website Zeta Tijuana reported.\\n\\nAccording to the newspaper Milenio, the Baja California Attorney General Office’s most solid line of investigation is that a drug cartel attempted to lure the 23-year-old to its ranks so that it could make use of his knowledge to manufacture drugs such as methamphetamine. But Delgado, a keen runner who taught boxing to disadvantaged kids in his spare time, refused.\\n\\nThe student was buried last week after a funeral service led by Rodrigo Salinas, a Tijuana priest. Delgado set an example for others by choosing good over evil, the priest said.\\n\\n“This is a message for all the young people who are carried away by the desire … for money and power,” Salinas told Milenio after the funeral service.\\n\\nDelgado’s death shocked and frightened other Tijuana university students, some of whom joined a protest on Saturday at the Tijuana campus of the National Pedagogical University (UPN), where the victim’s sister, Marena Delgado, studies.\\n\\nThe students demanded that Baja California authorities fulfill their responsibility to provide security to citizens and ensure that justice is served in the case of Delgado and other university students who have recently been murdered in Tijuana, among whom was Paulina Michelle Casillas Martínez, a UABC tourism studies major whose burnt body was found last week with that of her boyfriend, Humberto Mejía Sandoval, in a clandestine grave.\\n\\nTheir message was forceful but the turnout at the protest was small, a circumstance that was attributed to students’ fear that they too could be targeted by organized crime.\\n\\n“I believe that the clearest proof that young people are afraid is that they preferred not to come — not all of them — and we have to respect their decision and support them,” a UPN professor told Zeta Tijuana.\\n\\n“We don’t want to live with this fear,” one student said. “What happened to Juan Manuel Delgado Cárdenas happened at his home; it’s ugly that you’re not even safe in your own home. … I don’t want to be studying today and appear in the news tomorrow … [because] I was found in a [hidden] grave,” he said.\\n\\nA female student told Zeta that news of Delgado’s death was even more shocking because it occurred on Children’s Day and was witnessed by his younger brother.\\n\\n“How could you imagine that at a time of celebration, [criminals] would come and take [the life] of a person so close to you. … We’re here to ask for justice for all the students who are no longer with us and especially to support my classmate, Marena,” she said.\\n\\n“It makes me sad and angry,” another young woman said. “… We’re students.

              " 'As cryptocurrency grabs more and more headlines in the financial news, it is increasingly the chosen method for many Mexicans working in the United States to send home remittance payments.\\n\\nLast year, working migrants sent over US $40 billion to their families back home, 2.5-3% of which was processed by Mexico’s major cryptocurrency platform, Bitso, a total of $1.2 billion.\\n\\nCrypto platforms offer a vastly cheaper rate for sending those payments. Bitso charges commissions as low as $1 per $1,000 sent, while international transfer companies like Western Union charge an average fee of 10.9% per transaction.\\n\\nSending by crypto is also more efficient: direct account deposits can take up to five days while crypto transfers go directly to the recipient in a matter of minutes.\\n\\nTraditional financial instruments are foreign to many Mexicans but ease of use is pushing consumers towards crypto adoption. More than half of households do not have bank accounts, while 88% have the necessary technology for crypto trading: a smartphone.\\n\\nJesús Cervantes González, an economist with the Center for Latin American Monetary Studies (CEMLA), said the pandemic led migrants to search for digital solutions to send money home, as many traditional exchanges closed their doors to the public.\\n\\nMedia reports have stated that more Mexicans received money from the U.S. stimulus package via remittances than through any Mexican government benefits, although Cervantes said there are no statistics to prove such a claim.\\n\\nMaria Salgado, a Los Angeles resident originally from Oaxaca, has sent money home for 24 years to pay for her sister’s kidney treatments. She initially thought crypto currency was a scam, but became a convert in 2017. “I realized we were all fighting for the same thing: to have a better life,” she said.\\n\\nSalgado, a former factory worker, is currently invested in a crypto-mining rig — an advanced processing computer that mines cryptocurrency — being run out of Arizona. She also teaches cryptocurrency workshops online.\\n\\nThe growing power of digital currencies in Latin America is evidenced by Bitso’s success. After a funding round last week Latin America’s largest cryptocurrency platform became its first crypto unicorn, a term used to describe a privately-held startup valued at more than $1 billion. Bitso is now valued at $2.2 billion with more than one million users, primarily in Mexico and Argentina.\\n\\nEloisa Cadenas, CEO of consulting firm CryptoFinTech, says the platforms are filling a consumer demand. “In Mexico, Bitso made evident the advantages of using crypto for remittances. The exponential growth of this platform proves that it is really helping [recipients],” she said.\\n\\nSamuel Gómez Milano, co-founder of Venezuelan CoinGroup, expects the crypto remittance trend to continue. “The remittances market will continue to grow as long as the U.S. is rich and Latin America isn’t … There will always be migration, driven by the financial and labor disparities [between them],” he said.\\n\\nSources: Forbes, Rest of World',\n",

              " 'The Mexican marines carefully stacked the plastic drums one by one, dressed head to toe in white hazmat suits with gas masks tightly fastened around their faces to shield themselves from any toxic fumes.\\n\\nDeep in the sierra of the state of Sinaloa, long the cradle of the country’s drug trade, authorities counted the solid crystal and liquid methamphetamine, precursor chemicals and equipment found at the clandestine lab.\\n\\nOn that Friday, August 17, 2018, security units in the air and on the ground had flanked the town of Alcoyonqui, nested into the surrounding mountains less than an hour east of the bustling state capital, Culiacán. Beneath the main production site, the mega-lab was outfitted with two underground warehouses to store some of the partially processed liquid methamphetamine.\\n\\nIn total, authorities seized at least 50 tonnes of methamphetamine and precursor chemicals used to produce the synthetic drug. It was the largest such seizure in the country’s history, evidence of just how much organized crime groups — in this case the Sinaloa Cartel — had ramped up production to feed growing demand for the drug in the United States.\\n\\nThe seizure was another sign of the spectacular rise of illegal synthetic drugs, in particular the stimulant methamphetamine and the synthetic opioid fentanyl. The spike in production in Mexico and use in the United States has coincided with a similar spike in Mexican use, particularly of methamphetamine.\\n\\nMass production has led to drastically lower prices in both countries, and methamphetamine use now rivals other commonly consumed drugs in Mexico like marijuana.\\n\\nFrom US to Mexico production\\n\\nIt wasn’t always this way. Until the early 2000s, most of the methamphetamine consumed in the United States was produced in domestic laboratories, either tucked away in quiet suburbs outside of major cities or in rural communities. But by the 1990s and 2000s, mounting concerns regarding the dangers of the drug pushed lawmakers and law enforcement officials into action.\\n\\nIn 2004, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) recorded almost 24,000 domestic methamphetamine incidents, which included seizures of labs, dumpsites and chemical or glass equipment. Something had to be done. In 2005, U.S. lawmakers passed the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act which, among other things, sought to limit access to over-the-counter cold medicines that contain ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, key precursor ingredients for methamphetamine production.\\n\\nThe United States pushed for similar legislation in other countries, including Mexico, which adopted stricter drug controls starting in mid-2007.\\n\\nAt the same time, Mexican criminal organizations were evolving, developing increasingly sophisticated means of mass-producing methamphetamine and distributing it in vibrant U.S. drug markets. The Mexico-produced methamphetamine was both higher in purity and lower in price, and when the new controls on precursors began, the Mexican groups simply shifted gears, moving to more accessible and harder to control precursors. The U.S.-based producers could not compete.\\n\\nThe combination of the U.S. crackdown and the flood of Mexico methamphetamine gutted the U.S. production market. In 2019, the DEA recorded just 890 domestic methamphetamine incidents.\\n\\nNow, Mexican organized crime groups are the “primary producers and suppliers of low cost, high purity methamphetamine” sent to U.S. consumers, leading to “significant supply” of the synthetic drug in the U.S. market, according to the DEA.\\n\\nThe rise of methamphetamine in Mexico\\n\\nAs production ramped up, public health officials in Mexico started to notice the emerging threat methamphetamine posed amid a rise in addiction around 2009 or 2010. A decade later, the civil society-led Youth Integration Centers (CIJ), which work with the state’s health sector to combat drug use among youth, reported that methamphetamine use was rising exponentially, becoming the drug most reported by users seeking treatment in their facilities nationwide.\\n\\nWhat’s more, the CIJ report found that through the first half of 2020, a growing number of people in their care — more than ever before — reported using methamphetamine at least once in their life. Methamphetamine just barely outpaced cocaine, and fell behind only alcohol, tobacco and marijuana, which may soon be completely legal in Mexico.\\n\\n“We need to look at methamphetamine as the current substance that’s creating the most problems for people who use drugs in Mexico. We’ve seen an increase in consumption around the country and are suffering the unintended consequences of both preferences for substances and drug policy changes,” said Jaime Arredondo, a professor at the Drug Policy Program at the Center for Economic Research and Teaching (CIDE) in Aguascalientes.\\n\\nMethamphetamine is attractive for many reasons. It’s powerful, offers an intense high and is extremely cheap. A user in Mexico can buy one “rock” on the streets for 50 pesos, or around US $2 per dose. Combined with its easy accessibility and the fact that it can be produced in any climate, it comes as little surprise that methamphetamine has spread across the country as crime groups have boosted production to keep up with U.S. demand.\\n\\nIndeed, in Baja California state, a key drug trafficking corridor home to the border cities of Tijuana and Mexicali, the CIJ reported that methamphetamine was the drug most cited by users in their care between the second half of 2015 and the end of 2018, exceeding all other drugs, including marijuana.\\n\\nLast year in Tijuana, authorities seized 3,386 kilograms of methamphetamine, more than any other city and almost three times as much as Ensenada, which saw the second-highest rate of such seizures, according to government data compiled by the non-profit Mexico United Against Crime (MUCD).\\n\\nHowever, local drug users likely aren’t getting the high-quality product that consumers are in the United States. North of the border, the potency and purity of seized methamphetamine averages more than 97%. The drug is also increasingly being marketed – often unbeknownst to users – as counterfeit Adderall pills in places like New England. In 2019, the DEA made 115 methamphetamine seizures in pill form in that region. Before that, between 2015 and 2018, there were only 13 such pill seizures.\\n\\nBut while headline-grabbing news reports in Mexico often showcase the famous blue pills, Arredondo, the CIDE professor, says it’s extremely rare to see the regular users he interacts with in Tijuana and Mexicali using methamphetamine in pill form.\\n\\n“It could be that the best product just gets exported to its final destination in the United States, while users continue to use lower quality drugs here in Mexico,” Arredondo told InSight Crime.\\n\\nAnother side effect: violence\\n\\nGiven the rise of the market in the United States, securing safe transport of the high-quality product across the U.S.-Mexico border has become even more important, evidenced in the battles between drug trafficking groups and corrupt security officials operating along these routes. Baja California – just across the border from the San Ysidro port of entry, the busiest land border crossing in the Western Hemisphere – had the highest homicide rate of all of Mexico’s states in 2020, with nearly 80 per 100,000 citizens, more than double the national average.\\n\\nOf the 34,515 homicides recorded nationwide in 2020, the border city of Tijuana accounted for more than 4,000, or about 12% of all killings, the most of any town.\\n\\nThat said, rates of violence are not tied solely to the drug trade. Local economic and political interests also influence how power brokers use violence as a resource to establish order and maintain power, or to set new rules and configurations.\\n\\nFurther complicating things is the increasingly atomized nature of Mexico’s criminal landscape. Producing methamphetamine takes no agricultural know-how, unlike cultivating poppy for heroin or coca for cocaine. Anyone with access to precursor chemicals, the right infrastructure and the ability to follow a recipe can do it. This low bar of entry allows smaller startup groups to carve out a place for their own operations, taking advantage of a massive market with rising demand and prices.\\n\\nAs things stand now, the lucrative trade shows no signs of slowing, and use of the drug in Mexico is likely to continue. In 2019, Mexico’s National Statistics and Geography Institute (Inegi) reported that the number of citizens addicted to amphetamines jumped 775% since 2000.\\n\\nWith use growing, the array of players is widening. Last month, a former mayor was arrested for his role in brokering a multimillion-dollar deal on behalf of the so-called Cárteles Unidos to deliver half a tonne of methamphetamine hidden in concrete tiles and house paint to south Florida by truck.\\n\\nNot long after the arrest, members of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) — one of the main producers of synthetic drugs like methamphetamine — reportedly stormed Aguililla, the town in Michoacán state the former official once presided over, in what was the start of just the latest power struggle to be waged.\\n\\nThis is the third and final part of a series (read chapters one and two) in which InSight Crime has explored changing drug consumption patterns in the region and its impact on criminal dynamics. Parker Asmann is a writer with InSight Crime, a foundation dedicated to the study of organized crime in Latin America and the Caribbean.',\n",

In accordance with the bonds of solidarity and cooperation between both countries, he asked the United States to increase cooperation with Mexico to accelerate the pace of immunization in the country,” the statement said.\\n\\nThe meeting between López Obrador and Harris came a day after the federal government sent a diplomatic note to the United States to ask it to explain why it has provided funding to Mexicans Against Corruption and Impunity, a civil society organization that the president has accused of attempting to “sabotage” his administration.

There are just three high risk orange light states and none at the red light maximum risk level.\\n\\nThe 14 green states, an increase of eight compared to the map currently in force, will be Chiapas, Campeche, Coahuila, Veracruz, Jalisco, Guanajuato, Sonora, Nuevo León, Sinaloa, Durango, San Luis Potosí, Oaxaca, Tlaxcala and Nayarit. The first six states are already green while the other eight will switch from yellow.\\n\\nThe 15 yellow states, a decrease of five compared to the current map, will be Baja California, Zacatecas, Aguascalientes, Colima, Michoacán, Guerrero, Morelos, Puebla, Querétaro, Tamaulipas, México state, Yucatán, Baja California Sur, Hidalgo and Mexico City. The first 12 state are already yellow while the last three will switch from orange.\\n\\nThe three orange states for the next two weeks will be Chihuahua, Tabasco and Quintana Roo, all of which are already at the high risk level.\\n\\nEach stoplight color, determined by the Health Ministry using 10 different indicators including case numbers and hospital occupancy levels, is accompanied by recommended restrictions to slow the spread of the virus but it is ultimately up to state governments to decide on their own restrictions.\\n\\nIn addition to presenting the updated stoplight map, health official Ricardo Cortés displayed a graph at Friday night’s coronavirus press briefing that showed that the national hospital occupancy rate has declined 82% from the peak recorded at the start of the year, when many hospitals were overwhelmed with Covid patients. Only 11% of general care beds set aside for Covid patients are currently occupied while 16% of those with ventilators are in use.\\n\\nCortés also presented a graph that showed that Mexico’s epidemic curve has declined significantly in recent weeks. The number of new cases reported in April was 30% lower than March, while during the first seven days of May an average of 2,445 cases was reported daily, a 31% decline compared to last month’s daily average.\\n\\nThere are currently 21,706 active cases in the country, according to Health Ministry estimates. That number was above 100,000 at the peak of the second – and worst – wave of the virus in January.\\n\\nReported Covid deaths also declined in the first week of May to an average of 250 per day from 456 in April, a 45% drop.\\n\\nThe data on new cases for April and early May show that Mexico avoided a spike in infections that authorities warned could occur after last month’s Easter vacation period. Deputy Health Minister Hugo López-Gatell acknowledged Thursday that the feared third wave didn’t occur.\\n\\n“Very fortunately, the third wave didn’t arrive,” the coronavirus point man said, adding that health authorities had an obligation to warn of the risk as it urged the public to continue to take precautions over the Easter period. “There was success,” López-Gatell declared.\\n\\nStill, the fact remains that Mexico has been one of the world’s worst affected countries by the coronavirus pandemic. The national accumulated case tally – considered a vast undercount due to low testing rates – currently stands at 2.36 million, the 15th highest total in the world, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.\\n\\nThe official Covid-19 death toll – also widely believed to be a significant undercount – is 218,657, the world’s fourth highest total after those of the United States, Brazil and India.\\n\\nSource: El Universal (sp)',\n",

The family said Uruchurtu had denounced Huerta before state authorities for embezzlement of public resources before her disappearance.\\n\\nThe family said they received death threats via phone calls and acts of intimidation at their homes in Oaxaca after Uruchurtu disappeared. The Oaxaca human rights commission established a security escort for the family in response, and demanded that security and justice officials not harass the family or violate their human rights.\\n\\nUruchurtu’s accusations of financial impropriety were not the first for Mayor Huerta. On September 14 of last year, the state elections council said Huerta broke the law when she used public resources to fund personal propaganda. She faced other accusations of using public funds for her personal political goals in April and May 2020.\\n\\nThe March 26 protest where Uruchurtu disappeared was in response to the beating and arrest of a local man, allegedly on Huerta’s orders. Alfonso Avendaño, a supplier to the Nochixtlán government, showed up at government offices asking to be paid money he was owed. The mayor allegedly ordered local police to beat the man, leaving Avendaño with a fractured skull, according to his family. A witness who filmed the beating said she was later threatened by Huerta.\\n\\nThe mayor is currently seeking reelection as the Morena party’s candidate after having been chosen in an internal party survey. In reference to Uruchurtu’s disappearance, Huerta claimed to be the victim of a “dirty game” aimed at quashing her political ambitions.

He asserted that no TEPJF resources were used to pay for the restoration of his cars.\\n\\n“Everything has been paid out of my salary, all of the expenses agreed to were covered in advance. There was no use of public resources … and I have proof, I have everything documented,” Fuentes said.\\n\\n“I hired the mechanic from that workshop because I trusted him.

Golpismo is a movement that develops over time and can be completed by the army … but the conditions to carry out the coup are created with the support of foreign governments and the media,” he said.\\n\\nFounded in 2015, MCCI was part of a collective that filed more than 100 injunction requests against López Obrador’s cancellation of the former government’s Mexico City airport project and the current government’s construction of the airport at the Santa Lucía Air Force base.\\n\\nThe group has also published several reports that allege that López Obrador’s administration is plagued by corruption, including one about the government’s youth employment scheme and one about its tertiary education program.

The model doesn’t work.\\n\\nLast June we implemented a metered paywall that gives subscribers full access to our content while placing a limit on the number of stories non-subscribers could read in a 30-day period.\\n\\nThe decision was not easy. I knew it would cost us some traffic and, more seriously, some longtime readers but the necessity to do something to generate more revenue was obvious. The previous model was not sustainable and the only choice open to us was to ask readers for their support or shut down.\\n\\nThe most frequent of the questions and comments from readers since the paywall went up have demonstrated that few people realize how pitifully small are the revenues from online advertising.\\n\\nI was one of those people four years ago. I didn’t expect to make a lot of money, but there was an expectation that costs would be covered and a small profit made once readership reached a certain level.\\n\\nThe level was not established by market surveys and studies but by a rough calculation of the kind often done on napkins. The number was 100,000.\\n\\nIn February 2018 we had 300,000 readers and that number has steadily risen since (spiking to over 400,000 in March).\\n\\nSo we reached the target that I thought would give us financial stability, yet we’ve never had a month where advertising revenues exceeded US $5,000. I like to keep an eye on the numbers so I have a computer screen on my desk that shows me current reader numbers on the site and current revenues from our main ad network, Google AdSense.\\n\\nIt’s one o’clock in the afternoon and we’ve done $24 so far today. We’re a week into the month and the total is $292.\\n\\nI am reminded of one comment from a reader who declined to pay for his news. He accused us of being greedy.\\n\\nA reasonable profit is what we want and enough revenues to add more original content to the mix of curated stories we have always offered. Since we converted to a subscription model we have begun doing so.\\n\\nAnother goal was to create a better balance between good news and bad. Relying almost wholly on content curated from Mexican media has sometimes left us with an abundance of stories about murder and mayhem, and little else.\\n\\nThe big question I had before we made the leap to a paid circulation model was the only one that matters: why pay to read our content?\\n\\nNo other publication offers such a broad selection of news of particular interest to expats and investors in Mexico.

Ron Hubbard? Aunque no lo creas, mucho.\\n\\nAl querer entrar al lugar un hombre de estatura baja me prohibió el acceso —muy amablemente— y me explicó que sólo hay dos maneras de ingresar: Ser miembro o resolver un test de personalidad gratuito —y puso énfasis en esa palabra—. Al no encontrar más opción acepté realizar el cuestionario.\\n\\nEl templo es una extraña mezcla entre un lujoso hotel, librería y centro de convenciones. Al poner un pie dentro el caos del exterior desaparece. El ambiente pacífico se agradece.\\n\\nSin perder la enorme sonrisa el hombre me guió hasta un cuarto con espacios semiprivados y me dio un lápiz, goma y por supuesto, el test.\\n\\nSegún él, el \\'Análisis de Capacidad Oxford\\' tiene un costo real de 500 dólares pero yo tenía \\'la fortuna de estar ahí en ese preciso momento\\' y realizarlo gratis.\\n\\nEl examen consta de 200 preguntas que se responden con \\'Sí\\', \\'Quizá\\' y \\'No\\'.\\n\\nLas preguntas varian, desde ¿Sonríes mucho? y ¿Es tu vida una lucha por la supervivencia? hasta ¿Aceptarías someterte a un trato estricto por parte de un líder?\\n\\nCuando terminé y entregué el cuestionario me pidieron esperar en lo que calificaban mis resultados.\\n\\nPara hacer la espera amena una señorita —con impecable sonrisa— me sentó frente a una televisión y me dijo que me pondría un video sobre \\'Dianética\\' que \\'cambiaría mi manera de ver la vida\\'.\\n\\nEl video, entre otras cosas, intentaba dejar en claro que las enfermedades (incluyendo el cáncer) se pueden erradicar del cuerpo al \\'reprogramar la mente\\'\\n\\nMedia hora después escuché que me llamaban por mi nombre.\\n\\nTus resultados son interesantes, eres una persona muy abierta, con mucho qué decir pero sin el tacto para hacerlo, eso puede traerte un sinfín de problemas en tu día a día\".\\n\\nHasta ahí todo bien. Quizá en parte los resultados no están tan alejados de la realidad. Sin embargo, la seriedad —que hasta ese momento le había dado al asunto— se vino abajo cuando me dijo:\\n\\nTienes el potencial para cambiar al mundo pero no podrás hacerlo si no cambias tu manera de pensar, por suerte para ti tenemos el curso perfecto. Se llama \\'Valores e Integridad Personal\\', se realiza en sábado y tiene una duración de 15 horas. Por tan sólo 700 pesos obtendrás conocimientos con los que mejorarás tu vida. Tu tiempo compartido es la felicidad eterna\", aseguró.\\n\\nEn ese momento recordé el contrato de mil millones de años y lo cuestioné al respecto. Su sonrisa perfecta cambió y su expresión amable se volvió seria.\\n\\nEsos son temas que se tocan al pasar varios niveles de curso, si estás interesada puedes tomar los 18 cursos respectivos para adquirir esa información\".\\n\\nSe me quedó viendo esperando que sacara mi cartera y pagara el primer curso. Le dije que lo pensaría.\\n\\nComenzó a cuestionarme: ¿Qué te detiene para hacer el cambio en tu vida?”. Contesté que el dinero, que no lo traía e hizo una mueca de desagrado.\\n\\nRápidamente se levantó, me guió hacia un estante de libros, tomó uno —pesado— llamado \\'El Manual Sagrado de Scientology\\' —escrito, obviamente, por L. Ron Hubbard— y me prometió que si lo leía podría evitarme varios niveles de cursos.\\n\\nAl enseñarle mi bolsa vacía —sin cartera— continuó explicándome los beneficios de la dianética, la felicidad y el bien de la sociedad.\\n\\nTras el recorrido, que no pasó del primer piso, las respuestas a mis dudas fueron vagas. ¿En verdad ayudan a la gente o sólo es un negocio? Sinceramente no sé si salí con más preguntas que respuestas a como entré 2 horas antes. Lo que está claro es que día a día miles de mexicanos —para ser exactos 5 mil 500, según datos de Scientology México Centro Histórico— viven su vida inmersos en las reglas de la organización, entre ellas la llamada \\'desconexión\\', que obliga a sus fieles a separarse de sus familiares que no practican la fe.\\n\\nEsto es muy parecido a intentar tratar con un criminal. Si él no está dispuesto a manejar la situación, la sociedad recurre a la única solución que queda: ‘desconecta’ al criminal de la sociedad. En otras palabras, retira al individuo de la sociedad y lo mete en la cárcel porque él no está dispuesto a manejar su problema o, de otra forma, a dejar de cometer actos criminales contra otros” - Definición de L. Ron Hubbard.\\n\\nA diferencia de esta reportera, muchísimos interesados que acuden a realizar los test de personalidad terminan inscribiéndose a cursos y comprando libros para \\'ser mejores personas\\'.\\n\\nLos libros de L. Ron Hubbard —como cualquier otro bestseller— crean fascinación en las personas y en poco tiempo sus preceptos se vuelven el eje de sus vidas.\\n\\nHubbard era un hombre que creía que la manera más sencilla de hacer dinero era creando una religión y... lo logró.',\n",

Con Luis Campusano al bat, el relevista Jaime Schultz cometió un wild pitch que puso a Castillo en la antesala y luego caminó a Campusano.\\n\\nPatrick Kivlehan pegó elevado al central, Castillo anotó en pisa y corre para romper el empate y Campusano avanzó a la intermedia. O’Grady recibió base por bola intencional, Nick Tanielu fue pasaporteado y la casa se llenó de Chihuahuas. Pedro Filemón también recibió cuatro bolas malas, Campusano anotó de caballito para poner la pizarra 3-1 y las bases se mantuvieron llenas.\\n\\nFue el turno de Gosuke Katoh, que pegó un rodado por la primera, pero Sam Travis le lanzó muy alta la pelota al pitcher Schultz que llegó para apoyarlo y anotaron O’Grady y Tanielu para que los paseños se fueran arriba 5-1.\\n\\nLa pesadilla no terminaba para los de casa, pues Michael Cantú fue caminado y la casa se volvió a llenar. Fue entonces que el alto mando de los Rainiers decidió mandar a Yohan Ramírez a la loma de los disparos en lugar de Schultz.\\n\\nRamírez fue recibido con una rola al short de Ben Ruta, que puso out en segunda a Cantú, pero anotó Florimón la sexta carrera, Katoh llegó a tercera y Ruta logró embasarse. Iván Castillo pegó sencillo al cuadro por la tercera, Jantzen Witte ya no tuvo oportunidad de sacar algún out, Katoh anotó la séptima y Ruta llegó a la segunda.\\n\\nCampusano volvió al plato por segunda vez en este inning y una vez más recibió base por bolas para que la casa se volviera a llenar de Chihuahuas. Ramírez cometió un wild pitch y Ruta anotó la octava carrera para los caninos. Finalmente, Kivlehan fue dominado con un elevado al jardín izquierdo para el tercer out.\\n\\nChase Johnson fue enviado a la loma en el cierre de décimo inning, recibió dos hits y una carrera, pero pudo sacar los tres outs para que los Chihuahuas lograron su tercer triunfo de la temporada.',\n",

La audiencia incluirá a 2 mil 500 trabajadores clave y sus invitados, que recibieron boletos en reconocimiento a sus esfuerzos durante la pandemia.\\n\\n“Es el primer evento al que asistimos desde la pandemia, hay un gran revuelo”, dijo el enfermero policial Brian George, quien llevó a su hija de 18 años a la ceremonia. “Espero que con algunos otros eventos como éste de aquí al otoño sea como, vamos a abrir todo de nuevo. Eso sería fantástico”.\\n\\nLas cantautoras británicas Dua Lipa, Arlo Parks y Celeste compiten por tres Premios Brit, el equivalente británico de los Grammy. DJ Joel Corry y el dúo de rap Young T & Bugsey también cuentan con tres nominaciones cada uno.\\n\\nSwift será la primera mujer que reciba el premio al ícono global, anteriormente otorgado a superestrellas como Elton John y David Bowie. La cantautora estadounidense de 31 años, que también está nominada a mejor solista femenina internacional, es la artista que más discos ha vendido en el Reino Unido en lo que va de 2021 tras el lanzamiento de su álbum regrabado “Fearless”.\\n\\nEl comediante Jack Whitehall será el anfitrión de la ceremonia, y Lipa y la banda de rock Coldplay estarán entre los artistas que actuarán en la gala.\\n\\nEl piloto de los Brit es parte del Programa de Investigación de Eventos del gobierno, que recientemente ha visto a multitudes regresar a partidos de fútbol, un concierto al aire libre y un club nocturno. El secretario de Cultura, Oliver Dowden, había dicho que los premios de este año eran una oportunidad para “reunir al público en vivo con lo mejor del talento británico”.\\n\\nLos asistentes también serán evaluados y monitoreados después del evento como parte de la investigación.\\n\\nGran Bretaña ha registrado más de 127.500 muertes por coronavirus, pero los decesos se han reducido a un dígito tras un bloqueo a principios de 2021 y el rápido despliegue de vacunación.\\n\\nEl bloqueo se levanta lentamente y las medidas se relajarán aún más en Inglaterra el lunes con la reapertura de lugares de hospitalidad cubiertos y reuniones al aire libre de hasta 30 personas. Los lineamientos de distanciamiento social se mantendrán.\\n\\nTodas las restricciones se levantarán antes del 21 de junio, de acuerdo con el plan actual del gobierno. Conciertos y festivales de música regresarán por primera vez desde principios de 2020.\\n\\nLos Premios Brit han sido criticados en el pasado por no reflejar la diversidad musical del Reino Unido. En 2017, la academia de más de 1.000 profesionales de la industria de la música, que elige a los ganadores, se expandió en un intento de hacerla más equilibrada y diversa en cuanto a género.\\n\\nNo obstante, el año pasado el espectáculo fue criticado por no reconocer a las mujeres: no se incluyó a ninguna intérprete femenina en la lista de finalistas a álbum del año. Esta vez esa categoría incluye cuatro artistas femeninas: Parks, Celeste, Lipa y Jessie Ware. Un solo hombre, J Hus, compite con ellas.',\n",

Te juro que no te haré nada\". Replicó ella, desdeñosa: \"Si no me va a hacer nada ¿tons a qué vamos?\". (\"Tons\" es \"entonces\"). El oficial de la Border Patrol interrogó al indocumentado mexicano, norteño él: \"¿Nombre?\". \"Pancho\". \"¿Apellido?\". \"Garza Treviño\". \"¿Raza?\". \"¡De a madre, pelao!\". (Ser \"raza\" es, en el noreste, ser simpático, amable). Babalucas le contó a su vecino la experiencia que tuvo la noche anterior con una hermosa chica en el departamento de ella: \"Me recibió en negligé. Me sirvió una copa.Puso música romántica. Y luego apagó la luz\". Preguntó con marcado interés el vecino: \"Y tú ¿qué hiciste?\". Respondió el badulaque: \"Me fui a mi casa. Sé interpretar una indirecta\". Don Veterino, señor de numerosos calendarios, casó con Pomponona, mujer frondosa y joven. La noche de las bodas se dirigió a ella con emotivo acento: \"¿Me amas, Pompi?\". Contestó la desposada: \"Supongo que con el tiempo llegaré a quererlo, don Vetín. El problema es saber de cuánto tiempo disponemos\". Este amigo mío ríe sin motivo cuando empieza a beber, y cuando ya ha bebido llora por muchos motivos. La noche del sábado bebió para embriagarse, como hace siempre. \"Es la única forma que tengo de suspender la vida\", dice. Luego lloró como siempre, cosa que a los demás nos hace sentir un poco incómodos. En fin, a los amigos se les perdona todo, hasta que lloren el incómodo llanto de la borrachera. Evocó sus tiempos de estudiante. Vivía con tres compañeros de estudios en un departamento en la Ciudad de México. Les servía una señora de edad venida de un estado del sureste. Cierto día la mujer les dijo que trabajaba demasiado; se sentía cansada; necesitaba a alguien que la ayudara. Les pidió dinero para ir a su pueblo a traer una muchacha. Lo que trajo fue una muchachita. ¿Qué edad tendría? Imposible adivinarlo. Lo mismo podía ser de 15 años que de 20. \"¿Cómo te llamas?\". La única respuesta fue mirarlos con sus grandes ojos negros. \"No sabe\" -explicó la señora grande. \"Se llamará Lupita\" -decretó uno de los estudiantes. Y Lupita se llamó. No hablaba una palabra de español, pero cuando alguien decía \"Lupita\" acudía como un perrito obediente al escuchar su nombre. La señora del sureste nos dijo que la había comprado con el dinero que le dimos, y que por tanto nos pertenecía, igual que la mesa o las sillas. ¿Cómo empezó lo que a las pocas semanas empezó? Mi amigo recuerda que la primera vez se la rifaron, y luego se turnaban para estar con ella cuando no estaba la señora. Ésta se enteró de lo que sucedía y se marchó. No quería tener problemas. Al paso de los meses los estudiantes supieron con solo verla que la muchachita estaba embarazada. Echaron suertes otra vez para determinar quién se desharía de ella. La suerte le tocó a mi amigo. La llevó al mercado de la Merced y la dejó donde había más gente. Le dijo con señas que iba a hablar por teléfono, que no se moviera de ahí. Luego escapó. Nunca volvieron a saber de Lupita. Habíamos oído en silencio a mi amigo, pero nos incomodamos cuando rompió a llorar el incómodo llanto de la borrachera. De eso que nos contó este sábado hace más de 60 años. Nada ha cambiado desde entonces en algunas regiones del país. Ayer leí en Reforma que en algunos pueblos de Guerrero las niñas son vendidas por sus padres conforme a los usos y costumbres de sus etnias. Las costumbres y usos siguen siendo los mismos.

              " '\"La sana incertidumbre nos abraza... Ojalá y, por lo menos, aprendamos a no despreciar para entender mejor\".\\n\\nFederico Reyes Heroles\\n\\nCiudad de México.- El presidente logró que la Auditoría Superior de la Federación bajara su estimación del costo por cerrar el Nuevo Aeropuerto Internacional de México (NAIM) de 331 mil millones a 113 mil millones de pesos. Lo consiguió en parte al convencer a la ASF de no contabilizar como costos las deudas contraídas a través de instrumentos financieros (que me parece correcto), pero tampoco los costos futuros. Cabe preguntarse, sin embargo, ¿por qué sería un triunfo haber tirado a la basura \"solo\" 113 mil millones de pesos?\\n\\nNo es un monto pequeño. Rebasa en más de cuatro veces los 27 mil millones de pesos de la Línea 12 del Metro. con todo y sus sobrecostos. Al contrario de otros proyectos de gasto público, por otra parte, no nos dará a los ciudadanos nuevas instalaciones o infraestructura útil, sino que simplemente destruirá un proyecto que llevaba cuando menos un avance del 30 por ciento.\\n\\nEs un gasto, además, que evitará que tengamos en el futuro un hub, un centro internacional de conexiones de aviación, que podría generar decenas de miles de empleos bien pagados en nuestro país. Es muy posible que el nuevo aeropuerto Felipe Ángeles que la Secretaría de la Defensa está construyendo en la vieja base militar de Santa Lucía sea mucho más barato. Se calcula que el costo total de este será de 84 mil millones de pesos (aunque algunos análisis sugieren ya que podría duplicarse) contra unos 260 mil millones de pesos del NAIM. Su capacidad, sin embargo, será inferior, su distancia al centro de demanda mucho mayor (53 kilómetros contra 23 del NAIM) y su capacidad para convertirse en centro de conexiones muy reducida.\\n\\nHay otra diferencia quizá más importante. La mayor parte de la inversión en el NAIM iba a ser privada, mientras que toda la del Felipe Ángeles será pública y usará, por lo tanto, recursos que se pudieron haber empleado para proyectos de mayor beneficio social. El NAIM, además, contaba con estudios de factibilidad que señalaban que sería rentable, los cuales no se conocen para el Felipe Ángeles.\\n\\nHay otros costos ocultos. La cancelación, con una consulta amañada, mandó un mensaje de incertidumbre a los inversionistas, que se ha fortalecido con otros cierres de proyectos, como la cervecera de Constellation Brands en Mexicali. Con la cancelación del NAIM en octubre de 2018 dio comienzo una tendencia descendente de la inversión fija bruta en el país. Aun cuando el gobierno haya indemnizado, con dinero de los contribuyentes, a los constructores y tenedores de bonos, se sembró la idea de que podrá cancelar cualquier proyecto, por avanzado que sea, sin importar los costos y aunque cumplan todos los requisitos de ley.\\n\\nFrenar la construcción de un aeropuerto de 260 mil millones de pesos, con una pérdida de 113 mil millones para el erario, no debería ser una tragedia económica para un país como México, con un producto interno bruto de más de 24 billones de pesos. El problema, sin embargo, no es el costo contable, sino la incertidumbre. Cuando no hay certeza jurídica, es muy difícil invertir; y sin inversión no puede haber crecimiento ni prosperidad. Por eso el costo real de la cancelación del aeropuerto es muy superior a los 113 mil millones de pesos, aunque esta cifra se coloque oficialmente en los libros de contabilidad del proyecto.\\n\\nLo espectacular\\n\\n\"Al carajo! -dijo el presidente para explicar por qué no visitaba a las víctimas de la Línea 12--. No es ese mi estilo, eso tiene que ver más con lo espectacular y lo que se hacía antes\". Pero ayer hizo una conferencia de prensa en la que dijo: \"No vamos a informar nada, no vamos a contestar las preguntas de ustedes\". Presentó, en cambio, un espectáculo musical, quizá para mostrar que, en ciertos casos, sí le gusta lo espectacular.\\n\\nTwitter: @SergioSarmiento',\n",

When inspecting East China\\'s Jiangxi province in 2019, Xi spoke of the deeds of Liu Qiyao, a faithful and uncorrupted Party member.\\n\\nIn the 1930s, following the Red Army\\'s failure in a battle, Liu Qiyao, the leader of the Communist authority in Jiangxi province, lost connection with his comrades.\\n\\nLiu, who was entrusted with the activity funds of the local Party organization, including 13 golden bars, packed up the hidden funds, and embarked on a journey to find them during which he once lived a beggar\\'s life.\\n\\nAfter finally getting in touch with other Party members, Liu submitted the funds. To everyone\\'s surprise, none of the valuables were missing. Even in his most desperate days, Liu did not use any of the funds for himself.\\n\\n\"Only if we remain clean and upright in governance can we win public trust,\" Xi noted.\\n\\nDespite historic achievements made over the past years on fighting corruption, it remains the biggest risk to the Party\\'s governance, as Xi has pointed out.\\n\\nJust as Xi once put it, \"The governance over the Party must always be strict, so that the CPC can lead and ensure the smooth sailing of the great ship of socialism with Chinese characteristics.\"',\n",

He said the number could have been more if the COVID-19 pandemic had not occurred.\\n\\nCensus workers made home visits to collect data nationwide from October and December, when the outbreak was largely under control in China. But epidemic prevention and control measures had barred normal international passenger flow.\\n\\nThe latest census counted about 1.43 million overseas residents－a group comprising foreigners as well as people from the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions and the Chinese province of Taiwan－on the mainland by November.\\n\\nThe coastal province of Guangdong has the largest number of overseas residents at about 418,000, followed by Yunnan province and Shanghai.\\n\\nShanghai has a total of about 164,000 overseas residents, according to the census.

The city also leads in the introduction of visa policies to attract and retain international talent to work and set up business in the city.\\n\\nHowever, the census data also shows that the number of Taiwan residents on the mainland was less than a decade ago.\\n\\nCheng Po-yu, vice-president of the Taiwan Youth Council Beijing Association for Taiwan Enterprises, said that is partly because Taiwan businesses operating on the mainland are becoming more inclined to hire local workers, which led to a decline in the number of workers deployed from Taiwan.\\n\\n\"The labor force on the mainland is getting increasingly skilled in recent years, and more professional and efficient,\" he said.\\n\\nCheng noted that a growing number of young people from Taiwan have come to the mainland for education and started micro-businesses in recent years.\\n\\nCao Chen contributed to this story.',\n",

              " 'MA XUEJING/CHINA DAILY\\n\\nSocial media has become a channel for propaganda and an instrument of political destabilization\\n\\nThe creation of mass media has enhanced the effects of lying and manipulation. In the 1930s, media such as daily newspapers, cinema and radio were widely used by several countries\\' governments to mobilize their population for their political goals. This activity was pushed with the latest knowledge of social psychology, sociology, statistics, and semiotics. In Germany, Adolf Hitler and his minister of propaganda Joseph Goebbels explored all possibilities created by this knowledge to target the objectives of domination through propaganda.\\n\\nDuring the Cold War, the United States used mass media to push anti-communist propaganda that sought to demonize socialist governments like the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries and all the Third World\\'s national-democratic movements. Since then, international news has been filtered through agencies who work in line with their home country\\'s intelligence community.\\n\\nMcCarthyism sought to eliminate from US culture and media any positive reference associated with communism and used a lot the media manipulation. Hollywood films, for example, created negative stereotypes of Russians, Chinese and Cubans, among others, and went so far as to portray socialist countries as being eternally bleak, suppressing sunny days in scenes depicting these countries. The development of filming techniques enabled the construction of credible, albeit false, narratives.\\n\\nThe ability to manipulate society through control of the media has reached a new level with the emergence of social media and the availability of relatively cheap audio and video recording equipment. It is interesting to note that such social networks are controlled by a handful of companies that work closely with the US government. The revelations of Edward Snowden and Julian Assange reveal the intricate surveillance schemes organized by the information community in conjunction with telecommunications and big technology companies.\\n\\nSocial networks are being used on a large scale as instruments of political destabilization, propaganda and social control. We saw this in the so-called color revolutions in Ukraine, Myanmar, Syria, Egypt, Venezuela, Brazil and China\\'s Hong Kong special administrative region. The speed with which lies and prejudices are spread via social media is impressive. The Brexit referendum, the creation of far-right communities such as Q-Anon, demonstrate propaganda\\'s corrosive power through new technologies.\\n\\nWe are currently following the creation of false narratives by Western governments and media groups to demonize the People\\'s Republic of China on issues related to the novel coronavirus, the Hong Kong political process, technology and the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. Specifically, concerning Xinjiang, a false tale has been constructed that the central government is sponsoring a \"genocide\" against the Uygur ethnic group and that millions of Muslim people are being confined in \"concentration camps\" and used as \"forced labor\". These lies, like others, are like a house of cards, but when the lie is repeated a thousand times, it ends up confusing public opinion.\\n\\nThis narrative disregards the activism of radical groups that sought, based on another false tale that of an \"independent Turkistan\", to separate China\\'s region by violent means. There have been countless incidents involving bomb or knife attacks by members of these radical groups. It is worth remembering that this extreme \"wave \"spread in Central Asia after the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics collapsed, causing great turmoil, such as the Chechnya and Dagestan wars and, subsequently, with the profusion of radical Sunni groups after the attacks of Sept 11, 2001. It is in this context, the Shanghai Organization for Cooperation has emerged, aiming to guarantee political stability in Central Asia and combat extremist Islamic groups.\\n\\nChina\\'s approach to dealing with extremism differs significantly from that adopted by the US and its allies, namely the so-called war on terror, which has led to the destruction of countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Libya, and the deaths or exiles of millions of civilians. In China\\'s case, the strategy involves re-education and professional skills training for part of the population to create new opportunities, something far different from the \"concentration camps\" and \"forced labor\" the Western media and governments have sought to portray.\\n\\nThe lie machine is a well-oiled cog, as is the case with false narratives involving Muslims in Xinjiang. The fake news use testimonies from supposed academics and non-governmental organizations called \"independent\", which have the seal of the great media groups when repeating the lies a thousand times. In fact, these actions are coordinated by the intelligence services to destabilize governments that are considered hostile. In the name of \"freedom\", \"democracy\" and \"human rights\", para-state entities such as the National Endowment of Democracy (NED) have a structure for regimentation and staff training, which joins private organizations such as the Heritage Foundation, Charles Koch Foundation, Albert Einstein Institution or even media groups such as the Epoch Times newspaper, linked to the Falun Gong cult.\\n\\nUnfortunately, due to the strict control exercised by large Western news agencies, the false narratives are sold as if they were true. In this respect, social media tries to replicate and multiply the lies, as in the case of the alleged \"genocide\" in Xinjiang, the \"atrocities\" committed by the Syrian (or Libyan) government, the alleged lack of security of Huawei devices, and systems or still of \"systemic corruption\" in the Brazilian oil company Petrobras. Regarding this last aspect, between 2013 and 2018, Brazil faces mass demonstrations that look like a \"colored revolution\" supported by foreign forces.\\n\\nThe imposition of sanctions against Chinese authorities and Xinjiang\\'s cotton production is part of a narrative that is far removed from any concern about human rights. In fact, it aims to constrain and pressure the Chinese government in a broader context of disputes, such as the trade war and competition related to 5G and artificial intelligence, fields in which China excels.\\n\\nSimilarly, it seeks to isolate the Chinese government by creating artificial friction with European and Asian countries that are economically integrated with China and seeks to contain the advances of the Belt and Road Initiative.\\n\\nWhen the US is intensifying its strategy to contain China, it is important to pay attention to what the West\\'s propaganda mill is churning out. There is a need to redouble communication efforts to face the flood of lies and manipulation skillfully dealt with increasingly sophisticated resources. We know that the first victim of war is the truth and, because of this, the issue of information warfare must be handled very skillfully.\\n\\nThe author is a professor at the Sao Paulo State University (UNESP) in Brazil.

[Photo/Xinhua]\\n\\nUNITED NATIONS, May - A UN report has revised up the world economic growth as a result of robust rebounds in China and the United States, but warned against fragilities in other economies in the context of COVID-19.\\n\\nIn its mid-year update of its World Economic Situation and Prospects 2021, which was released in January 2021, the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) now predicts the world economy will grow 5.4 percent in 2021 instead of the 4.7 percent forecast in January 2021.\\n\\nFollowing a sharp contraction of 3.6 percent in 2020, the world economy will return to positive territory as the world\\'s two largest economies -- China and the United States -- will register impressive growth, according to the mid-year update, which was released on Tuesday.\\n\\nDESA revised its forecast for China from 7.2 percent to 8.2 percent; and for the United States from 3.4 percent to 6.2 percent for 2021.\\n\\nWhile the global growth outlook has improved, surging COVID-19 infections and inadequate vaccination progress in many countries threaten a broad-based recovery of the world economy, warned the report.\\n\\nThe pandemic is far from over for a majority of countries. Daily new infections were higher in April 2021 than the number of new infections reported daily during the peak of the pandemic in December 2020, the report noted.\\n\\nWith the risks of a prolonged pandemic and insufficient fiscal space to stimulate demand, the world\\'s most vulnerable countries are facing the prospect of a lost decade. The growth outlook in several countries in South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean, remains fragile and uncertain. For many developing countries, economic output is only projected to return to pre-pandemic levels in 2022 or 2023, according to the report.\\n\\n\"Vaccine inequity between countries and regions is posing a significant risk to an already uneven and fragile global recovery,\" said UN Chief Economist Elliott Harris in a press release. \"Timely and universal access to COVID-19 vaccinations will mean the difference between ending the pandemic promptly and placing the world economy on the trajectory of a resilient recovery, or losing many more years of growth, development and opportunities.\"\\n\\nThe report also highlighted the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on women.\\n\\nThe pandemic has pushed an estimated 114.4 million people into extreme poverty, of which 57.8 million are women and girls. Job and income losses have been higher for women, as more women than men left the workforce to meet family demands. Women\\'s health and reproductive health suffered massive blows, unintended pregnancies increased, motherhood was delayed, and education disrupted, significantly undermining progress toward gender equality. Women also faced increased gender-based violence, and women entrepreneurs were disproportionately affected by business closures, further widening gender gaps in income and wealth.\\n\\nThese severe and disproportionate impacts on women and girls call for more targeted policies and support measures, not only to accelerate the recovery but also to ensure that the recovery is inclusive and resilient, said the report.',\n",

A botanical garden complements the galleries with plants and large exhibits, creating an exquisite, elegant and relaxing atmosphere.\\n\\nIn 1938 the museum was turned into a horse stable by the Japanese invaders, with the collections and the architecture largely destroyed. After the founding of the People\\'s Republic of China in 1949, Nantong Museum was restored to its former glory with collections substantially enriched and the architecture rebuilt. Today the museum’s collection exceeds 50,000items, covering historical relics, folk art and fossils. Historical relics mostly represent the local culture of Nantong from ancient times to the present day, while natural objects reflect not only the plants and animals in Nantong, but also across the country and the world. The museum continually expands its collections. In 1979 the museum acquired a skeleton of a 10-meter-long whale which had been stranded in shallow water near Nantong, and a few years later part of a meteorite that fell on Lüsi, Nantong, in 1982 joined the museum collection.\\n\\nPermanent exhibitions feature history spanning more than a century, art masterpieces, the civilization, urbanization, and modernization of Nantong, as well as whale species found around the coasts of China.

However, after a year in Europe, she cut short her contract to return to the Chinese Women\\'s Super League.\\n\\n\"There\\'s no doubt, there were many fans for me in the stands when I played for PSG.

XINHUA\\n\\nBack in La Liga and back among the goals－that\\'s the plan for Wu Lei next season after Espanyol secured a return to Spain\\'s top flight at the first attempt last weekend.\\n\\nThe Chinese striker has been a bit-part player for the Barcelona-based club this term, with his 66th-minute introduction off the bench in Saturday\\'s 0-0 draw at Real Zaragoza typical of his frustrating campaign－when minutes and goals have been scarce for the 29-year-old.\\n\\nWu\\'s tribulations have sparked speculation he could choose to call it quits at Espanyol and seek a fresh start at another European club or back in China.\\n\\nHowever, speaking before Saturday\\'s promotion-clinching victory, Wu was again keen to stress his commitment to the club where he began his European adventure in such promising fashion just over three years ago.\\n\\n\"Just like I wrote in my personal blog many times before－once you chose a path, no matter how difficult it can be for you, you need to try your best to keep moving forward,\" Wu told thepaper.cn.\\n\\n\"I never said I can no longer keep playing with Espanyol. But some media or fans might think this way. This is all outside noise. I will keep on fighting for my foreign career.\"\\n\\nSaturday\\'s result meant Espanyol clinched promotion with four games to spare. It currently leads the Spanish second division on 78 points, six ahead of second-place Real Mallorca.\\n\\nHaving fallen down the pecking order at the club, Wu has contributed only three goals and two assists in 32 appearances－10 of those starts－in all competitions this term.\\n\\nWu\\'s struggles have been magnified by the burden of becoming the only Chinese international to play in a major European league when he arrived at Espanyol from Shanghai Port (then known as Shanghai SIPG) in 2018.\\n\\nHe hit the ground running in Spain, becoming the first Chinese player to score in La Liga and helping the team rise from relegation trouble to Europa League qualification in 2019.\\n\\nHowever, the COVID-19 pandemic marked a turning point in Wu\\'s fortunes, with the forward and his wife testing positive for the coronavirus last March.\\n\\nWhen he finally returned to the pitch after beating the virus, Wu failed to avert Espanyol\\'s relegation to the second tier.\\n\\nThe team\\'s slide has not been helped by a revolving door of head coaches in recent seasons. Current boss Vicente Moreno is the sixth head coach Wu has worked under at Espanyol, and Wu clearly has his work cut out to persuade Moreno he should be in his starting XI every week.\\n\\nWu, though, has been keen to play down the idea that Moreno is the source of his problems on the pitch.\\n\\n\"I saw some fans online blame the head coach.

The nine-time All-Star and 2016-17 MVP finished with 28 points, 13 rebounds and 21 assists as he carried the load for a Wizards team missing Bradley Beal, the league\\'s No 2 scorer.\\n\\n\"Honestly it never really bothered me one way or another,\" Westbrook said. \"I\\'m very confident in the things I do for this game. I take a lot of pride in going out and preparing myself to be one of the most consistent guys in this league.

Washington dropped to 25-5 when leading at the intermission.\\n\\nWashington center Robin Lopez felt blessed to play alongside Westbrook on the record-breaking night.\\n\\n\"He\\'s been relentless,\" Lopez said. \"He\\'s been locked in and that\\'s something that anyone on the roster will tell you. It\\'s trickled down to everybody. It\\'s certainly a boon to have him on the floor with us.\"\\n\\nWestbrook got his 8,000th career assist in early in the first.

              " 'CAO YI/FOR CHINA DAILY\\n\\nChina\\'s successful counterterrorism and de-radicalization measures in Xinjiang withstand the attempts to defame them\\n\\nThe Xinjiang-related issues that are making headlines in the West are not about human rights, nor are they about ethnicity or religious belief. They are simply lies fabricated by the United States with the purpose of sowing discord within China and alienating China from the rest of the international community.\\n\\n\"Things to Know About All the Lies on Xinjiang: How Have They Come About\", a report released by China Watch Institute, reveals \"an industrial chain\" whose purpose is to hype up Xinjiang-related issues with the aim of containing, destabilizing and weakening China.\\n\\nThe Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, like any other parts of China, has benefited a lot from the targeted poverty alleviation drive the country has implemented in recent years. The region has shaken off extreme poverty and the living standards of people of all ethnic groups have improved greatly. The region once again enjoys social stability and economic development thanks to the counterterrorism and de-radicalization measures introduced in recent years.\\n\\nBut manipulated by the US, Xinjiang-related issues have been cloaked in human rights, ethnic minority rights, freedom of religious belief and cultural diversity to cater to tastes of Western media outlets, academic communities and the public in order to mobilize anti-China forces. Yet it is absurd to say that the US cares about the human rights of Muslims as the last several decades have witnessed the US military forces trampling over human rights in Islamic countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria.\\n\\nXinjiang-related issues have been hyped up by organized forces with deliberate planning and cross-sector cooperation, demonstrating a top-down mechanism to manipulate Xinjiang-related issues. Any incidents that are worth sensationalizing are hyped up by some pet think tanks and media outlets. Anti-China forces in the US Congress will later submit bills to legalize sanction, then anti-China proposals are submitted in international organizations such as the United Nations Human Rights Council to internationalize Xinjiang-related issues and counter China.\\n\\nFirst, \"facts\" are fabricated for speculation. According to the China Watch Institute report, most figures and events in the cases that allegedly show disappearances and deaths of people in Xinjiang are completely inconsistent with the facts. Nonetheless, these cases which are mostly fabricated by the core persons of the World Uyghur Congress and a cohort of Xinjiang separatists living overseas are repeatedly cited by Western media and human rights organizations. Many online videos showing \"violation of human rights in Xinjiang\" actually present scenes in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iraq and Syria. The Chinese government\\'s poverty-reduction efforts of providing free vocational training and introducing jobs for migrant workers in Xinjiang－which is actually common in other provinces－are also distorted as \"forced labor\" practices.\\n\\nThese \"facts\" are then sensationalized by US media outlets. Radio Free Asia, a US government-funded news agency, has employed a group of Xinjiang separatists who are also employed by US intelligence agencies to spread rumors and create trouble. Some Western media outlets that pride themselves on their professionalism have produced reports based on the presumption that China is guilty of the allegations of these troublemakers. Some Western reporters who have claimed to have conducted impartial \"interviews\" in Xinjiang have spread their unsubstantiated eye-catching reports on social media platforms in order to attract eyeballs and manipulate public opinion.\\n\\nThe academic community has also been involved. In recent years, seminars on Xinjiang-related issues and research reports have increased substantially, with academic papers published by scholars who have never been to Xinjiang.\\n\\nAdrian Zenz is one of them. He is touted as a Xinjiang expert by the US government and some media, but he has never been to Xinjiang and his papers are full of fallacies that are against common sense and academic norms. The source of his data is just Radio Free Asia.\\n\\nThe Australian Strategic Policy Institute is to be blamed for hyping up the alleged \"forced labor\" in Xinjiang first. Most of the information and data in its research reports are cited from other papers full of speculation and inferences, of which the main authors are anti-China extremists.\\n\\nOnce the issues are stirred up, politicians will take up the baton. Anti-China members of the US Congress have used topics such as \"forced labor\" and \"monitoring and privacy invasion\" to impose sanctions on China. Since 2019, some members of Congress have been attempting to develop a system of on-target sanctions through special bills under the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act upper-level legislation. With these bills, the US government is able to apply sanctions for various purposes including undermining China\\'s supply chain and weakening its technological and industrial advantages.\\n\\nFor a long time, terrorism and extremism have posed great threats to social stability and economic development in Xinjiang. To cope with the challenges, the Chinese government has focused on boosting economic growth and targeted poverty alleviation and launched de-radicalization measures in the region, making notable achievements. Xinjiang has seen no violent or terrorism incidents for nearly four years. De-radicalization measures centering on vocational training and standard Chinese teaching have been launched to help local ethnic minorities get more employment opportunities, which is expected to fundamentally eliminate extremism and ensure long-term stability and people\\'s wellbeing.\\n\\nIn recent years, the per capita income in Xinjiang has grown by more than 8 percent year-on-year, much higher than the country\\'s average. By the end of 2020, the last 10 impoverished counties in Xinjiang shook off poverty. In 2019, the region welcomed more than 210 million tourists from home and abroad, a sharp increase of 42 percent year-on-year. With religious freedom, it now has more than 24,000 mosques, meaning that there is one mosque for every 530 Muslims.\\n\\nWhile terrorism is the common enemy of humankind, de-radicalization is our common cause. Some countries such as the US have politicized Xinjiang-related issues and spread rumors to contain China, even not hesitating to undermine the global anti-terrorism and de-radicalization efforts. However, the plot of smearing China on Xinjiang-related issues to contain its development is bound to fail.\\n\\nThe author is a professor with the Institute of Middle East Studies, Shanghai International Studies University.

              " 'Cao Yi | China Daily\\n\\nThe New York Times ran a scaremongering piece on Sunday speculating about the nefarious intentions of China\\'s growing media presence across the world. Titled \"When Covid Hit, China Was Ready To Tell Its Version Of The Story\", the article is partly based on an upcoming report to be released this Wednesday by the International Federation of Journalists about this topic. According to the NYT, it\\'ll accuse China of \"spreading disinformation\" and imply it attaches strings to cooperation on key challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nHypocritically, however, the NYT sprinkles its own disinformation into the article by parroting debunked claims about the situations in Hong Kong and Xinjiang while portraying China\\'s media presence in a negative light.\\n\\nThe purpose of such an article isn\\'t to inform the targeted audience, but to push a political narrative intended to trigger a paranoid reaction from its readers. The NYT mentions several times in its piece how China seems to be taking its soft power more seriously than the US. Quite predictably, the average person who reads that piece without any additional knowledge or context might be left with a bad impression about Chinese media, perhaps even wondering why the US isn\\'t doing more to counter it, which seems to be the reaction the NYT hopes to provoke.\\n\\nThe US is waging a hybrid war on China, which relies on disinformation to discredit its so-called \"peer competitor\". One of the sneakiest methods that\\'s been employed is to reverse the roles of the US and Chinese media by presenting the former as more trustworthy than the latter. In reality, however, American media has been known to lie about practically every political issue at home and abroad. Regarding the domestic front, few Americans have full faith in their media after the past four years of conspiracy theorizing between Democrats and Republicans. When it comes to foreign topics, everyone remembers how the US media spread lies about Iraq\\'s \"weapons of mass destruction\" to provoke war.\\n\\nThere are countless other examples, but everyone should get the point that\\'s being made. By contrast, Chinese media hasn\\'t ever been caught red-handed lying to the world like the US media has. Nor, for that matter, does it participate in regime change operations such as the ones its American counterparts actively led in West Asia (particularly Egypt, Libya, and Syria from 2011) and Eastern Europe (Yugoslavia in 2000, Ukraine in 2013-2014, and Belarus from last year onward), among many others. Objectively speaking, the only \"legitimate critique\" that can be made about Chinese media is the facts and arguments it presents are \"politically inconvenient\" to the disinformation-driven Western narrative.\\n\\nIn other words, an ironic reversal of perceptions has actually taken place. The average Westerner had long thought their part of the world has the honor of hosting the most reliable, professional and transparent media in the world, presumably due to its self-described \"democratic\" system of governance they believed made it superior to non-Western democracies like China\\'s. In truth, however, the oligarchic nature of Western democracy has irredeemably corrupted the so-called \"fourth estate\" to the point where it\\'s little more than a perception management tool by self-interested elites. It no longer serves to educate and inform, but to mislead and indoctrinate.\\n\\nIt\\'s why some Westerners are confused whenever they consume information from non-Western media such as China\\'s. Many of them have never heard the facts and arguments presented therein, which sometimes trigger cognitive dissonance due to decades of indoctrination. Increasingly, however, many Westerners are actively seeking out non-Western sources of news and analysis because of how much they\\'ve recently come to distrust their own media. This emerging trend strikes fear in the hearts of the Western elite because they belatedly realize they\\'ve lost their former narrative monopoly due to their own dishonesty.\\n\\nThis explains the desperate push by the NYT and others to discredit Chinese media, to cling to their fading narrative monopoly for just a little bit longer. It\\'s an exercise in vain, however, since the wheels of history are turning and the West\\'s former control of the world is rapidly becoming a thing of the past. Nowhere is this more visible than by the rising popularity of Chinese and other non-Western media outlets. While many Westerners might still live in an \"information bubble\", bombarded on a daily basis by disinformation from their own media, more and more are choosing to liberate their minds by seeking out alternative sources of information. Try as they might, the NYT and those like it cannot reverse this inevitable trend.\\n\\nAndrew Korybko is a Moscow-based American political analyst.\\n\\nThe opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.\\n\\nIf you have a specific expertise and would like to contribute to China Daily, please contact us at opinion@chinadaily.com.cn, and comment@chinadaily.com.cn.',\n",
              " 'This bird eye view shows the coral reefs in China\\'s Xisha Islands, South China Sea.[Photo/Xinhua]\\n\\nA recent article published by Philippine Daily Inquirer by the retired Philippine Supreme Court Justice Antonio T. Carpio sought to support Philippine sovereignty over the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea by claiming that the country had the \"oldest documentary evidence\". However, a review of history shows that the Philippines has no historical basis for its claim to the Spratly Islands, by contrast, sufficient historical records and archeological evidence consolidate the basis of China\\'s sovereignty to features in the South China Sea.\\n\\nThe Scarborough Shoal and Spratly Islands stayed beyond the attention of the Spanish colonial empire\\n\\nThe territorial formation of the Philippines can be traced back to the 16th century when Spain began to colonize the islands in 1565, with Miguel López de Legazpi establishing the first permanent Spanish settlement in Cebu. Up to 1898, when the proclamation of a republic marked the Filipinos as the first Asian people to try to throw off European colonial rule, the Philippine Archipelago was incorporated into the so-called Spanish colonial empire.\\n\\nFor over three hundred years, the policy of the Spanish colonial administration was more economic than political, designed to exploit the region\\'s rich natural resources. As such, the colonial administration of the Philippines, like that of Spanish colonies in Latin America, aimed at supporting the mother state with wealth from colonies through conquest, commerce and trade. In the Philippine Archipelago, the Manila-based Spanish colonial government took complete control of all affairs relating to economic life, in order to secure a perfect monopoly of trade and commerce. It exploited the fertile soil for commercial agricultural products such as tobacco and coffee and implemented a system of oppressive taxation to raise revenue.\\n\\nTherefore, all the colonial laws and regulations were made to control trade, commerce, agriculture, finance, taxation, the foundation of municipalities, the management of the natives, the control of mines, etc. By contrast, the Spanish in the Philippines did not achieve much progress concerning political affairs, creating a loose colonial administration instead of a strong centralized government.\\n\\nWithin such a regime, the Spanish did not have a clear and precise understanding of the size and border of their colonial territory. Regarding the features in the South China Sea including the Scarborough Shoal and Spratly Islands, no convincing documents have proved the Spanish seized them. There are at least two reasons for explanation.\\n\\nFirst, a strong focus on economic benefits meant that the Spanish colonial government had no interest in offshore islands which were uninhabited and of no economic importance. Second, the establishment of a central authority in the colonies was a burden on Spain. It was thus impossible for the Spanish to waste limited resources to seize and occupy islands in the South China Sea.\\n\\nThat\\'s also why when the US and Spain concluded their treaty in 1898, the officials of US government held different opinions concerning the territories for cession since even the Spanish themselves did not have a comprehensive understanding of the size of their colony.\\n\\nThe 1734 Murillo Velarde map is unacceptable as uncorroborated evidence\\n\\nThe 1734 Murillo Velarde Map (also known as Carta Hydrographica Y Chorographica de las Yslas Filipinas) has been used by the Philippine government on various occasions as a historical evidence to support its claim to Scarborough shoal. Based on details on the map, the Philippine government deems that the shoal named Panacot (or Masinloc on other maps) lying to the west coast of Luzon Island is Scarborough Shoal.\\n\\nSuch an assertion has already been criticized and corrected by academia. This is not only because there are very few ancient maps supporting this conclusion, but because plenty more maps since the late 18th century clearly indicate that Scarborough Shoal is not Panacot.\\n\\nPanacot and two shoals appear for the first time on a map in 1590, when the Portuguese cartographer Bartolomeu Lasso made a chart of the coastal seas of South and Southeast Asia. He drew a group of three shoals to the west coast of Luzon Island, as his contemporary navigators thought that this region was dangerous for navigation.\\n\\nFrom the eighteenth century onwards, the British and Spanish conducted several surveys in these waters and confirmed that the three shoals did not exist in reality. They eventually discovered the real Scarborough Shoal and confirmed its true geographical position. Such a geographical discovery proves that Panocat is not Scarborough Shoal and the 1734 map is not reliable.\\n\\nThe progress of surveys was reflected by numerous maps published in the late 18th and 19th centuries. For instance, in 1775, the French navigator Jean Baptist Nicholas D. de Mannevillette published his Neptune Oreintal (Second Edition) in Paris, in which A Chart of the China Sea originally drawn by British cartographer Alexander Dalrymple was included. On the chart, the \"Scarboro\" was for the first time marked to the west of the group of three shoals. The co-appearance of Scarborough and Panocot again disproves the Philippine assertion that Scarborough Shoal is Panocot and historically belongs to the Philippines.\\n\\nA part of the A Chart of the China Sea shows the co-existence of the Scarborough Shoal and the group of three shoals to the west coast of Luzon Island.\\n\\nA part of the A Chart of the China Sea shows the co-existence of the Scarborough Shoal and the group of three shoals to the west coast of Luzon Island.\\n\\nThe Treaty of Paris and Treaty of Washington do not refer to the Scarborough Shoal and Spratly Islands\\n\\nScarborough Shoal lies around 230 kilometers to the west of coast of Luzon Island. The Spanish did not know its precise position until the late 18th century. Considering they were of no economic importance and were uninhabitable, the Spanish colonial government had no reason to incorporate it and Spratly Islands into its colonial territory. This explains why the 1898 Treaty of Paris and 1900 Treaty of Washington between Spain and the United States have no words on Scarborough Shoal or the Spratly Islands.\\n\\nJustice Carpio and many other Philippine officials have frequently quoted the Treaty of Washington which states that \"any islands belonging to the Philippine archipelago, lying outside the lines…as if they had been expressly included within those lines\", as a historical evidence to claim the Scarborough Shoal and Spratly Islands which lie beyond the lines defined by the Treaty of Paris. It is necessary to point out that the Philippine quotation is incomplete. The following sentence \"and particularly to the islands of Cagayan, Sulu and Sibutu and their dependencies\" provides additional information explaining which islands lie outside the lines belonged to the Philippine Archipelago. It is thus evident that the Scarborough Shoal and Spratly Islands were not part of the territory ceded to the US, because they had been never part of Spanish colonial empire as discussed above.\\n\\nThat is also why when the French illegally occupied nine islands in the South China Sea in 1933, the Philippine ex-Senator Isabelo de los Reyes noticed and wrote a letter to the Governor General William Francis Murphy to take measures to claim the islands. The letter was forwarded to the War Department which held a cautious attitude as the US thought there was no basis for such a claim.\\n\\nVarious historical evidence supports China\\'s legal claim to the Scarborough Shoal and Spratly Islands.\\n\\nContrary to the fake and weak historical evidence supporting the Philippines\\' claim to Scarborough Shoal and Spratly Island, China has plenty of historical documentary and archaeological evidence to confirm China\\'s historical authority over these islands.\\n\\nFirst, Chinese official and private historical records, document, maps, charts and other types of evidence show Chinese expeditions in the South China Sea as early as the Han Dynasty (206 BC - 220 AD). These historical sources, such as Yi Wu Zhi (Records of Rarities), Chufan Chi, and the official chronicles of each dynasty, also record Chinese activities in the South China Sea, including the naming the features, navigation and commerce in the sea, jurisdiction over the islands, etc.\\n\\nIn the 20th century, the Republic of China government entrusted administration of the South China Sea to the local government in Hainan, which was a special prefecture within Guangdong Province until April 1988 when it was \"upgraded\" to the status of a province. The Republic of China continued to exercise authority over the South China Sea islands through such means as granting licenses or contracts to private Chinese merchants for the development and exploitation of guano and other natural resources on the islands in the South China Sea. Official and non-official maps published in the Republic era invariably include the Spratly Islands as Chinese territory.\\n\\nThird, folk literature, such as Geng Lu Bu (manual of sea routes created by Chinese fishermen) record navigation and fishery activities by Chinese people dating back 600 years. These people sailed to and through the Spratly Islands smoothly, gave names to the features according to their common knowledge, and fished in the region. All these indicate their acquaintance with the Spratly Islands, which could not be obtained without lasting and consistent practice.\\n\\nFourth, archaeological discoveries demonstrate China\\'s historical ties to the South China Sea. Temples, coins, wells and other traces of Chinese living activities have been discovery on the islands in the South China Sea. Archaeological excavation of shipwreck sites in the South China Sea also prove continual Chinese commercial and shipping activities.\\n\\nFifth, China\\'s sailing, exploration, and exploitation experience in the South China Sea is richly recorded in the historical sources of various Western countries, including the archives of colonial governments and trading companies to personal records such as travel accounts, navigation logs, etc. For instance, in the 17th and 18th centuries, European commercial companies relied on Chinese traditional sailing routes and trading networks when navigating the waters and conducting commerce in Asia. John Crawfurd, a Scottish colonial administrator and diplomat in the 1830s observed Chinese mariners sailing through the South China Sea to Batavia (now Jakarta), indicating the Spratly Islands was historically known to Chinese mariners.\\n\\nA short conclusion\\n\\nThe continua Chinese activities since ancient times have confirmed China\\'s consistent administration and exploitation of the South China Sea resources. Such historical-truth based practice by Chinese government and people became the historical basis for the nine-dashed line, which legally sets forth China\\'s historic title over the South China Sea. Such solid historical foundation cannot be eroded and shaken by the historical fictions of people like Justice Carpio.\\n\\nThe author is a postdoctoral researcher at National Institute of South China Sea Studies.',\n",

            "\n",
            "On that Friday, August 17, 2018, security units in the air and on the ground had flanked the town of Alcoyonqui, nested into the surrounding mountains less than an hour east of the bustling state capital, Culiacán. Beneath the main production site, the mega-lab was outfitted with two underground warehouses to store some of the partially processed liquid methamphetamine.\n",
            "\n",
            "In total, authorities seized at least 50 tonnes of methamphetamine and precursor chemicals used to produce the synthetic drug. It was the largest such seizure in the country’s history, evidence of just how much organized crime groups — in this case the Sinaloa Cartel — had ramped up production to feed growing demand for the drug in the United States.\n",
            "\n",
            "The seizure was another sign of the spectacular rise of illegal synthetic drugs, in particular the stimulant methamphetamine and the synthetic opioid fentanyl. The spike in production in Mexico and use in the United States has coincided with a similar spike in Mexican use, particularly of methamphetamine.\n",
            "\n",
            "Mass production has led to drastically lower prices in both countries, and methamphetamine use now rivals other commonly consumed drugs in Mexico like marijuana.\n",

            "From US to Mexico production\n",
            "\n",
            "It wasn’t always this way. Until the early 2000s, most of the methamphetamine consumed in the United States was produced in domestic laboratories, either tucked away in quiet suburbs outside of major cities or in rural communities. But by the 1990s and 2000s, mounting concerns regarding the dangers of the drug pushed lawmakers and law enforcement officials into action.\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2004, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) recorded almost 24,000 domestic methamphetamine incidents, which included seizures of labs, dumpsites and chemical or glass equipment. Something had to be done. In 2005, U.S. lawmakers passed the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act which, among other things, sought to limit access to over-the-counter cold medicines that contain ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, key precursor ingredients for methamphetamine production.\n",
            "\n",
            "The United States pushed for similar legislation in other countries, including Mexico, which adopted stricter drug controls starting in mid-2007.\n",
            "\n",
            "At the same time, Mexican criminal organizations were evolving, developing increasingly sophisticated means of mass-producing methamphetamine and distributing it in vibrant U.S. drug markets. The Mexico-produced methamphetamine was both higher in purity and lower in price, and when the new controls on precursors began, the Mexican groups simply shifted gears, moving to more accessible and harder to control precursors. The U.S.-based producers could not compete.\n",
            "\n",
            "The combination of the U.S. crackdown and the flood of Mexico methamphetamine gutted the U.S. production market. In 2019, the DEA recorded just 890 domestic methamphetamine incidents.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, Mexican organized crime groups are the “primary producers and suppliers of low cost, high purity methamphetamine” sent to U.S. consumers, leading to “significant supply” of the synthetic drug in the U.S. market, according to the DEA.\n",
            "\n",
            "The rise of methamphetamine in Mexico\n",
            "\n",
            "As production ramped up, public health officials in Mexico started to notice the emerging threat methamphetamine posed amid a rise in addiction around 2009 or 2010. A decade later, the civil society-led Youth Integration Centers (CIJ), which work with the state’s health sector to combat drug use among youth, reported that methamphetamine use was rising exponentially, becoming the drug most reported by users seeking treatment in their facilities nationwide.\n",
            "\n",
            "What’s more, the CIJ report found that through the first half of 2020, a growing number of people in their care — more than ever before — reported using methamphetamine at least once in their life. Methamphetamine just barely outpaced cocaine, and fell behind only alcohol, tobacco and marijuana, which may soon be completely legal in Mexico.\n",
            "\n",
            "“We need to look at methamphetamine as the current substance that’s creating the most problems for people who use drugs in Mexico. We’ve seen an increase in consumption around the country and are suffering the unintended consequences of both preferences for substances and drug policy changes,” said Jaime Arredondo, a professor at the Drug Policy Program at the Center for Economic Research and Teaching (CIDE) in Aguascalientes.\n",
            "\n",
            "Methamphetamine is attractive for many reasons. It’s powerful, offers an intense high and is extremely cheap. A user in Mexico can buy one “rock” on the streets for 50 pesos, or around US $2 per dose. Combined with its easy accessibility and the fact that it can be produced in any climate, it comes as little surprise that methamphetamine has spread across the country as crime groups have boosted production to keep up with U.S. demand.\n",
            "\n",
            "Indeed, in Baja California state, a key drug trafficking corridor home to the border cities of Tijuana and Mexicali, the CIJ reported that methamphetamine was the drug most cited by users in their care between the second half of 2015 and the end of 2018, exceeding all other drugs, including marijuana.\n",
            "\n",
            "Last year in Tijuana, authorities seized 3,386 kilograms of methamphetamine, more than any other city and almost three times as much as Ensenada, which saw the second-highest rate of such seizures, according to government data compiled by the non-profit Mexico United Against Crime (MUCD).\n",
            "\n",
            "However, local drug users likely aren’t getting the high-quality product that consumers are in the United States. North of the border, the potency and purity of seized methamphetamine averages more than 97%. The drug is also increasingly being marketed – often unbeknownst to users – as counterfeit Adderall pills in places like New England. In 2019, the DEA made 115 methamphetamine seizures in pill form in that region. Before that, between 2015 and 2018, there were only 13 such pill seizures.\n",
            "\n",
            "But while headline-grabbing news reports in Mexico often showcase the famous blue pills, Arredondo, the CIDE professor, says it’s extremely rare to see the regular users he interacts with in Tijuana and Mexicali using methamphetamine in pill form.\n",
            "\n",
            "“It could be that the best product just gets exported to its final destination in the United States, while users continue to use lower quality drugs here in Mexico,” Arredondo told InSight Crime.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another side effect: violence\n",
            "\n",
            "Given the rise of the market in the United States, securing safe transport of the high-quality product across the U.S.-Mexico border has become even more important, evidenced in the battles between drug trafficking groups and corrupt security officials operating along these routes. Baja California – just across the border from the San Ysidro port of entry, the busiest land border crossing in the Western Hemisphere – had the highest homicide rate of all of Mexico’s states in 2020, with nearly 80 per 100,000 citizens, more than double the national average.\n",
            "\n",
            "Of the 34,515 homicides recorded nationwide in 2020, the border city of Tijuana accounted for more than 4,000, or about 12% of all killings, the most of any town.\n",
            "\n",
            "That said, rates of violence are not tied solely to the drug trade. Local economic and political interests also influence how power brokers use violence as a resource to establish order and maintain power, or to set new rules and configurations.\n",
            "\n",
            "Further complicating things is the increasingly atomized nature of Mexico’s criminal landscape. Producing methamphetamine takes no agricultural know-how, unlike cultivating poppy for heroin or coca for cocaine. Anyone with access to precursor chemicals, the right infrastructure and the ability to follow a recipe can do it. This low bar of entry allows smaller startup groups to carve out a place for their own operations, taking advantage of a massive market with rising demand and prices.\n",
            "\n",
            "As things stand now, the lucrative trade shows no signs of slowing, and use of the drug in Mexico is likely to continue. In 2019, Mexico’s National Statistics and Geography Institute (Inegi) reported that the number of citizens addicted to amphetamines jumped 775% since 2000.\n",
            "\n",
            "With use growing, the array of players is widening. Last month, a former mayor was arrested for his role in brokering a multimillion-dollar deal on behalf of the so-called Cárteles Unidos to deliver half a tonne of methamphetamine hidden in concrete tiles and house paint to south Florida by truck.\n",

            "Not long after the arrest, members of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) — one of the main producers of synthetic drugs like methamphetamine — reportedly stormed Aguililla, the town in Michoacán state the former official once presided over, in what was the start of just the latest power struggle to be waged.\n",

Te juro que no te haré nada\". Replicó ella, desdeñosa: \"Si no me va a hacer nada ¿tons a qué vamos?\". (\"Tons\" es \"entonces\"). El oficial de la Border Patrol interrogó al indocumentado mexicano, norteño él: \"¿Nombre?\". \"Pancho\". \"¿Apellido?\". \"Garza Treviño\". \"¿Raza?\". \"¡De a madre, pelao!\". (Ser \"raza\" es, en el noreste, ser simpático, amable). Babalucas le contó a su vecino la experiencia que tuvo la noche anterior con una hermosa chica en el departamento de ella: \"Me recibió en negligé. Me sirvió una copa.Puso música romántica. Y luego apagó la luz\". Preguntó con marcado interés el vecino: \"Y tú ¿qué hiciste?\". Respondió el badulaque: \"Me fui a mi casa. Sé interpretar una indirecta\". Don Veterino, señor de numerosos calendarios, casó con Pomponona, mujer frondosa y joven. La noche de las bodas se dirigió a ella con emotivo acento: \"¿Me amas, Pompi?\". Contestó la desposada: \"Supongo que con el tiempo llegaré a quererlo, don Vetín. El problema es saber de cuánto tiempo disponemos\". Este amigo mío ríe sin motivo cuando empieza a beber, y cuando ya ha bebido llora por muchos motivos. La noche del sábado bebió para embriagarse, como hace siempre. \"Es la única forma que tengo de suspender la vida\", dice. Luego lloró como siempre, cosa que a los demás nos hace sentir un poco incómodos. En fin, a los amigos se les perdona todo, hasta que lloren el incómodo llanto de la borrachera. Evocó sus tiempos de estudiante. Vivía con tres compañeros de estudios en un departamento en la Ciudad de México. Les servía una señora de edad venida de un estado del sureste. Cierto día la mujer les dijo que trabajaba demasiado; se sentía cansada; necesitaba a alguien que la ayudara. Les pidió dinero para ir a su pueblo a traer una muchacha. Lo que trajo fue una muchachita. ¿Qué edad tendría? Imposible adivinarlo. Lo mismo podía ser de 15 años que de 20. \"¿Cómo te llamas?\". La única respuesta fue mirarlos con sus grandes ojos negros. \"No sabe\" -explicó la señora grande. \"Se llamará Lupita\" -decretó uno de los estudiantes. Y Lupita se llamó. No hablaba una palabra de español, pero cuando alguien decía \"Lupita\" acudía como un perrito obediente al escuchar su nombre. La señora del sureste nos dijo que la había comprado con el dinero que le dimos, y que por tanto nos pertenecía, igual que la mesa o las sillas. ¿Cómo empezó lo que a las pocas semanas empezó? Mi amigo recuerda que la primera vez se la rifaron, y luego se turnaban para estar con ella cuando no estaba la señora. Ésta se enteró de lo que sucedía y se marchó. No quería tener problemas. Al paso de los meses los estudiantes supieron con solo verla que la muchachita estaba embarazada. Echaron suertes otra vez para determinar quién se desharía de ella. La suerte le tocó a mi amigo. La llevó al mercado de la Merced y la dejó donde había más gente. Le dijo con señas que iba a hablar por teléfono, que no se moviera de ahí. Luego escapó. Nunca volvieron a saber de Lupita. Habíamos oído en silencio a mi amigo, pero nos incomodamos cuando rompió a llorar el incómodo llanto de la borrachera. De eso que nos contó este sábado hace más de 60 años. Nada ha cambiado desde entonces en algunas regiones del país. Ayer leí en Reforma que en algunos pueblos de Guerrero las niñas son vendidas por sus padres conforme a los usos y costumbres de sus etnias. Las costumbres y usos siguen siendo los mismos. Qué vergüenza. Si ahora estuviera yo borracho -y solo- lloraría el incómodo llanto de la borrachera. FIN.\n",

Lo consiguió en parte al convencer a la ASF de no contabilizar como costos las deudas contraídas a través de instrumentos financieros (que me parece correcto), pero tampoco los costos futuros. Cabe preguntarse, sin embargo, ¿por qué sería un triunfo haber tirado a la basura \"solo\" 113 mil millones de pesos?\n",
            "\n",
            "No es un monto pequeño. Rebasa en más de cuatro veces los 27 mil millones de pesos de la Línea 12 del Metro. con todo y sus sobrecostos. Al contrario de otros proyectos de gasto público, por otra parte, no nos dará a los ciudadanos nuevas instalaciones o infraestructura útil, sino que simplemente destruirá un proyecto que llevaba cuando menos un avance del 30 por ciento.\n",
            "\n",
            "Es un gasto, además, que evitará que tengamos en el futuro un hub, un centro internacional de conexiones de aviación, que podría generar decenas de miles de empleos bien pagados en nuestro país. Es muy posible que el nuevo aeropuerto Felipe Ángeles que la Secretaría de la Defensa está construyendo en la vieja base militar de Santa Lucía sea mucho más barato. Se calcula que el costo total de este será de 84 mil millones de pesos (aunque algunos análisis sugieren ya que podría duplicarse) contra unos 260 mil millones de pesos del NAIM. Su capacidad, sin embargo, será inferior, su distancia al centro de demanda mucho mayor (53 kilómetros contra 23 del NAIM) y su capacidad para convertirse en centro de conexiones muy reducida.\n",
            "\n",
            "Hay otra diferencia quizá más importante. La mayor parte de la inversión en el NAIM iba a ser privada, mientras que toda la del Felipe Ángeles será pública y usará, por lo tanto, recursos que se pudieron haber empleado para proyectos de mayor beneficio social. El NAIM, además, contaba con estudios de factibilidad que señalaban que sería rentable, los cuales no se conocen para el Felipe Ángeles.\n",
            "\n",
            "Hay otros costos ocultos. La cancelación, con una consulta amañada, mandó un mensaje de incertidumbre a los inversionistas, que se ha fortalecido con otros cierres de proyectos, como la cervecera de Constellation Brands en Mexicali. Con la cancelación del NAIM en octubre de 2018 dio comienzo una tendencia descendente de la inversión fija bruta en el país. Aun cuando el gobierno haya indemnizado, con dinero de los contribuyentes, a los constructores y tenedores de bonos, se sembró la idea de que podrá cancelar cualquier proyecto, por avanzado que sea, sin importar los costos y aunque cumplan todos los requisitos de ley.\n",

El problema, sin embargo, no es el costo contable, sino la incertidumbre. Cuando no hay certeza jurídica, es muy difícil invertir; y sin inversión no puede haber crecimiento ni prosperidad. Por eso el costo real de la cancelación del aeropuerto es muy superior a los 113 mil millones de pesos, aunque esta cifra se coloque oficialmente en los libros de contabilidad del proyecto.\n",

            "The creation of mass media has enhanced the effects of lying and manipulation. In the 1930s, media such as daily newspapers, cinema and radio were widely used by several countries' governments to mobilize their population for their political goals. This activity was pushed with the latest knowledge of social psychology, sociology, statistics, and semiotics. In Germany, Adolf Hitler and his minister of propaganda Joseph Goebbels explored all possibilities created by this knowledge to target the objectives of domination through propaganda.\n",
            "\n",
            "During the Cold War, the United States used mass media to push anti-communist propaganda that sought to demonize socialist governments like the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries and all the Third World's national-democratic movements. Since then, international news has been filtered through agencies who work in line with their home country's intelligence community.\n",
            "\n",
            "McCarthyism sought to eliminate from US culture and media any positive reference associated with communism and used a lot the media manipulation. Hollywood films, for example, created negative stereotypes of Russians, Chinese and Cubans, among others, and went so far as to portray socialist countries as being eternally bleak, suppressing sunny days in scenes depicting these countries. The development of filming techniques enabled the construction of credible, albeit false, narratives.\n",
            "\n",
            "The ability to manipulate society through control of the media has reached a new level with the emergence of social media and the availability of relatively cheap audio and video recording equipment. It is interesting to note that such social networks are controlled by a handful of companies that work closely with the US government. The revelations of Edward Snowden and Julian Assange reveal the intricate surveillance schemes organized by the information community in conjunction with telecommunications and big technology companies.\n",
            "\n",
            "Social networks are being used on a large scale as instruments of political destabilization, propaganda and social control. We saw this in the so-called color revolutions in Ukraine, Myanmar, Syria, Egypt, Venezuela, Brazil and China's Hong Kong special administrative region. The speed with which lies and prejudices are spread via social media is impressive. The Brexit referendum, the creation of far-right communities such as Q-Anon, demonstrate propaganda's corrosive power through new technologies.\n",
            "\n",
            "We are currently following the creation of false narratives by Western governments and media groups to demonize the People's Republic of China on issues related to the novel coronavirus, the Hong Kong political process, technology and the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. Specifically, concerning Xinjiang, a false tale has been constructed that the central government is sponsoring a \"genocide\" against the Uygur ethnic group and that millions of Muslim people are being confined in \"concentration camps\" and used as \"forced labor\". These lies, like others, are like a house of cards, but when the lie is repeated a thousand times, it ends up confusing public opinion.\n",
            "\n",
            "This narrative disregards the activism of radical groups that sought, based on another false tale that of an \"independent Turkistan\", to separate China's region by violent means. There have been countless incidents involving bomb or knife attacks by members of these radical groups. It is worth remembering that this extreme \"wave \"spread in Central Asia after the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics collapsed, causing great turmoil, such as the Chechnya and Dagestan wars and, subsequently, with the profusion of radical Sunni groups after the attacks of Sept 11, 2001. It is in this context, the Shanghai Organization for Cooperation has emerged, aiming to guarantee political stability in Central Asia and combat extremist Islamic groups.\n",

            "China's approach to dealing with extremism differs significantly from that adopted by the US and its allies, namely the so-called war on terror, which has led to the destruction of countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Libya, and the deaths or exiles of millions of civilians. In China's case, the strategy involves re-education and professional skills training for part of the population to create new opportunities, something far different from the \"concentration camps\" and \"forced labor\" the Western media and governments have sought to portray.\n",
            "\n",
            "The lie machine is a well-oiled cog, as is the case with false narratives involving Muslims in Xinjiang. The fake news use testimonies from supposed academics and non-governmental organizations called \"independent\", which have the seal of the great media groups when repeating the lies a thousand times. In fact, these actions are coordinated by the intelligence services to destabilize governments that are considered hostile. In the name of \"freedom\", \"democracy\" and \"human rights\", para-state entities such as the National Endowment of Democracy (NED) have a structure for regimentation and staff training, which joins private organizations such as the Heritage Foundation, Charles Koch Foundation, Albert Einstein Institution or even media groups such as the Epoch Times newspaper, linked to the Falun Gong cult.\n",
            "\n",
            "Unfortunately, due to the strict control exercised by large Western news agencies, the false narratives are sold as if they were true. In this respect, social media tries to replicate and multiply the lies, as in the case of the alleged \"genocide\" in Xinjiang, the \"atrocities\" committed by the Syrian (or Libyan) government, the alleged lack of security of Huawei devices, and systems or still of \"systemic corruption\" in the Brazilian oil company Petrobras. Regarding this last aspect, between 2013 and 2018, Brazil faces mass demonstrations that look like a \"colored revolution\" supported by foreign forces.\n",

            "In its mid-year update of its World Economic Situation and Prospects 2021, which was released in January 2021, the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) now predicts the world economy will grow 5.4 percent in 2021 instead of the 4.7 percent forecast in January 2021.\n",
            "\n",
            "Following a sharp contraction of 3.6 percent in 2020, the world economy will return to positive territory as the world's two largest economies -- China and the United States -- will register impressive growth, according to the mid-year update, which was released on Tuesday.\n",
            "\n",
            "DESA revised its forecast for China from 7.2 percent to 8.2 percent; and for the United States from 3.4 percent to 6.2 percent for 2021.\n",

            "While the global growth outlook has improved, surging COVID-19 infections and inadequate vaccination progress in many countries threaten a broad-based recovery of the world economy, warned the report.\n",
            "\n",
            "The pandemic is far from over for a majority of countries. Daily new infections were higher in April 2021 than the number of new infections reported daily during the peak of the pandemic in December 2020, the report noted.\n",
            "\n",
            "With the risks of a prolonged pandemic and insufficient fiscal space to stimulate demand, the world's most vulnerable countries are facing the prospect of a lost decade. The growth outlook in several countries in South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean, remains fragile and uncertain. For many developing countries, economic output is only projected to return to pre-pandemic levels in 2022 or 2023, according to the report.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Vaccine inequity between countries and regions is posing a significant risk to an already uneven and fragile global recovery,\" said UN Chief Economist Elliott Harris in a press release. \"Timely and universal access to COVID-19 vaccinations will mean the difference between ending the pandemic promptly and placing the world economy on the trajectory of a resilient recovery, or losing many more years of growth, development and opportunities.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "The report also highlighted the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on women.\n",
            "\n",
            "The pandemic has pushed an estimated 114.4 million people into extreme poverty, of which 57.8 million are women and girls. Job and income losses have been higher for women, as more women than men left the workforce to meet family demands. Women's health and reproductive health suffered massive blows, unintended pregnancies increased, motherhood was delayed, and education disrupted, significantly undermining progress toward gender equality. Women also faced increased gender-based violence, and women entrepreneurs were disproportionately affected by business closures, further widening gender gaps in income and wealth.\n",
            "\n",
            "These severe and disproportionate impacts on women and girls call for more targeted policies and support measures, not only to accelerate the recovery but also to ensure that the recovery is inclusive and resilient, said the report.\n",

A botanical garden complements the galleries with plants and large exhibits, creating an exquisite, elegant and relaxing atmosphere.\n",

After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Nantong Museum was restored to its former glory with collections substantially enriched and the architecture rebuilt. Today the museum’s collection exceeds 50,000items, covering historical relics, folk art and fossils. Historical relics mostly represent the local culture of Nantong from ancient times to the present day, while natural objects reflect not only the plants and animals in Nantong, but also across the country and the world. The museum continually expands its collections. In 1979 the museum acquired a skeleton of a 10-meter-long whale which had been stranded in shallow water near Nantong, and a few years later part of a meteorite that fell on Lüsi, Nantong, in 1982 joined the museum collection.\n",

            "China's successful counterterrorism and de-radicalization measures in Xinjiang withstand the attempts to defame them\n",
            "\n",
            "The Xinjiang-related issues that are making headlines in the West are not about human rights, nor are they about ethnicity or religious belief. They are simply lies fabricated by the United States with the purpose of sowing discord within China and alienating China from the rest of the international community.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Things to Know About All the Lies on Xinjiang: How Have They Come About\", a report released by China Watch Institute, reveals \"an industrial chain\" whose purpose is to hype up Xinjiang-related issues with the aim of containing, destabilizing and weakening China.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, like any other parts of China, has benefited a lot from the targeted poverty alleviation drive the country has implemented in recent years. The region has shaken off extreme poverty and the living standards of people of all ethnic groups have improved greatly. The region once again enjoys social stability and economic development thanks to the counterterrorism and de-radicalization measures introduced in recent years.\n",
            "\n",
            "But manipulated by the US, Xinjiang-related issues have been cloaked in human rights, ethnic minority rights, freedom of religious belief and cultural diversity to cater to tastes of Western media outlets, academic communities and the public in order to mobilize anti-China forces. Yet it is absurd to say that the US cares about the human rights of Muslims as the last several decades have witnessed the US military forces trampling over human rights in Islamic countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria.\n",
            "\n",
            "Xinjiang-related issues have been hyped up by organized forces with deliberate planning and cross-sector cooperation, demonstrating a top-down mechanism to manipulate Xinjiang-related issues. Any incidents that are worth sensationalizing are hyped up by some pet think tanks and media outlets. Anti-China forces in the US Congress will later submit bills to legalize sanction, then anti-China proposals are submitted in international organizations such as the United Nations Human Rights Council to internationalize Xinjiang-related issues and counter China.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, \"facts\" are fabricated for speculation. According to the China Watch Institute report, most figures and events in the cases that allegedly show disappearances and deaths of people in Xinjiang are completely inconsistent with the facts. Nonetheless, these cases which are mostly fabricated by the core persons of the World Uyghur Congress and a cohort of Xinjiang separatists living overseas are repeatedly cited by Western media and human rights organizations. Many online videos showing \"violation of human rights in Xinjiang\" actually present scenes in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iraq and Syria. The Chinese government's poverty-reduction efforts of providing free vocational training and introducing jobs for migrant workers in Xinjiang－which is actually common in other provinces－are also distorted as \"forced labor\" practices.\n",
            "\n",
            "These \"facts\" are then sensationalized by US media outlets. Radio Free Asia, a US government-funded news agency, has employed a group of Xinjiang separatists who are also employed by US intelligence agencies to spread rumors and create trouble. Some Western media outlets that pride themselves on their professionalism have produced reports based on the presumption that China is guilty of the allegations of these troublemakers. Some Western reporters who have claimed to have conducted impartial \"interviews\" in Xinjiang have spread their unsubstantiated eye-catching reports on social media platforms in order to attract eyeballs and manipulate public opinion.\n",
            "\n",
            "The academic community has also been involved. In recent years, seminars on Xinjiang-related issues and research reports have increased substantially, with academic papers published by scholars who have never been to Xinjiang.\n",
            "\n",
            "Adrian Zenz is one of them. He is touted as a Xinjiang expert by the US government and some media, but he has never been to Xinjiang and his papers are full of fallacies that are against common sense and academic norms. The source of his data is just Radio Free Asia.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Australian Strategic Policy Institute is to be blamed for hyping up the alleged \"forced labor\" in Xinjiang first. Most of the information and data in its research reports are cited from other papers full of speculation and inferences, of which the main authors are anti-China extremists.\n",
            "\n",
            "Once the issues are stirred up, politicians will take up the baton. Anti-China members of the US Congress have used topics such as \"forced labor\" and \"monitoring and privacy invasion\" to impose sanctions on China. Since 2019, some members of Congress have been attempting to develop a system of on-target sanctions through special bills under the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act upper-level legislation. With these bills, the US government is able to apply sanctions for various purposes including undermining China's supply chain and weakening its technological and industrial advantages.\n",
            "\n",
            "For a long time, terrorism and extremism have posed great threats to social stability and economic development in Xinjiang. To cope with the challenges, the Chinese government has focused on boosting economic growth and targeted poverty alleviation and launched de-radicalization measures in the region, making notable achievements. Xinjiang has seen no violent or terrorism incidents for nearly four years. De-radicalization measures centering on vocational training and standard Chinese teaching have been launched to help local ethnic minorities get more employment opportunities, which is expected to fundamentally eliminate extremism and ensure long-term stability and people's wellbeing.\n",
            "\n",
            "In recent years, the per capita income in Xinjiang has grown by more than 8 percent year-on-year, much higher than the country's average. By the end of 2020, the last 10 impoverished counties in Xinjiang shook off poverty. In 2019, the region welcomed more than 210 million tourists from home and abroad, a sharp increase of 42 percent year-on-year. With religious freedom, it now has more than 24,000 mosques, meaning that there is one mosque for every 530 Muslims.\n",
            "\n",
            "While terrorism is the common enemy of humankind, de-radicalization is our common cause. Some countries such as the US have politicized Xinjiang-related issues and spread rumors to contain China, even not hesitating to undermine the global anti-terrorism and de-radicalization efforts. However, the plot of smearing China on Xinjiang-related issues to contain its development is bound to fail.\n",

            "Cao Yi | China Daily\n",
            "\n",
            "The New York Times ran a scaremongering piece on Sunday speculating about the nefarious intentions of China's growing media presence across the world. Titled \"When Covid Hit, China Was Ready To Tell Its Version Of The Story\", the article is partly based on an upcoming report to be released this Wednesday by the International Federation of Journalists about this topic. According to the NYT, it'll accuse China of \"spreading disinformation\" and imply it attaches strings to cooperation on key challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
            "\n",
            "Hypocritically, however, the NYT sprinkles its own disinformation into the article by parroting debunked claims about the situations in Hong Kong and Xinjiang while portraying China's media presence in a negative light.\n",
            "\n",
            "The purpose of such an article isn't to inform the targeted audience, but to push a political narrative intended to trigger a paranoid reaction from its readers. The NYT mentions several times in its piece how China seems to be taking its soft power more seriously than the US. Quite predictably, the average person who reads that piece without any additional knowledge or context might be left with a bad impression about Chinese media, perhaps even wondering why the US isn't doing more to counter it, which seems to be the reaction the NYT hopes to provoke.\n",
            "\n",
            "The US is waging a hybrid war on China, which relies on disinformation to discredit its so-called \"peer competitor\". One of the sneakiest methods that's been employed is to reverse the roles of the US and Chinese media by presenting the former as more trustworthy than the latter. In reality, however, American media has been known to lie about practically every political issue at home and abroad. Regarding the domestic front, few Americans have full faith in their media after the past four years of conspiracy theorizing between Democrats and Republicans. When it comes to foreign topics, everyone remembers how the US media spread lies about Iraq's \"weapons of mass destruction\" to provoke war.\n",
            "\n",
            "There are countless other examples, but everyone should get the point that's being made. By contrast, Chinese media hasn't ever been caught red-handed lying to the world like the US media has. Nor, for that matter, does it participate in regime change operations such as the ones its American counterparts actively led in West Asia (particularly Egypt, Libya, and Syria from 2011) and Eastern Europe (Yugoslavia in 2000, Ukraine in 2013-2014, and Belarus from last year onward), among many others. Objectively speaking, the only \"legitimate critique\" that can be made about Chinese media is the facts and arguments it presents are \"politically inconvenient\" to the disinformation-driven Western narrative.\n",
            "\n",
            "In other words, an ironic reversal of perceptions has actually taken place. The average Westerner had long thought their part of the world has the honor of hosting the most reliable, professional and transparent media in the world, presumably due to its self-described \"democratic\" system of governance they believed made it superior to non-Western democracies like China's. In truth, however, the oligarchic nature of Western democracy has irredeemably corrupted the so-called \"fourth estate\" to the point where it's little more than a perception management tool by self-interested elites. It no longer serves to educate and inform, but to mislead and indoctrinate.\n",
            "\n",
            "It's why some Westerners are confused whenever they consume information from non-Western media such as China's. Many of them have never heard the facts and arguments presented therein, which sometimes trigger cognitive dissonance due to decades of indoctrination. Increasingly, however, many Westerners are actively seeking out non-Western sources of news and analysis because of how much they've recently come to distrust their own media. This emerging trend strikes fear in the hearts of the Western elite because they belatedly realize they've lost their former narrative monopoly due to their own dishonesty.\n",
            "\n",
            "This explains the desperate push by the NYT and others to discredit Chinese media, to cling to their fading narrative monopoly for just a little bit longer. It's an exercise in vain, however, since the wheels of history are turning and the West's former control of the world is rapidly becoming a thing of the past. Nowhere is this more visible than by the rising popularity of Chinese and other non-Western media outlets. While many Westerners might still live in an \"information bubble\", bombarded on a daily basis by disinformation from their own media, more and more are choosing to liberate their minds by seeking out alternative sources of information. Try as they might, the NYT and those like it cannot reverse this inevitable trend.\n",

            "\n",
            "A recent article published by Philippine Daily Inquirer by the retired Philippine Supreme Court Justice Antonio T. Carpio sought to support Philippine sovereignty over the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea by claiming that the country had the \"oldest documentary evidence\". However, a review of history shows that the Philippines has no historical basis for its claim to the Spratly Islands, by contrast, sufficient historical records and archeological evidence consolidate the basis of China's sovereignty to features in the South China Sea.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Scarborough Shoal and Spratly Islands stayed beyond the attention of the Spanish colonial empire\n",
            "\n",
            "The territorial formation of the Philippines can be traced back to the 16th century when Spain began to colonize the islands in 1565, with Miguel López de Legazpi establishing the first permanent Spanish settlement in Cebu. Up to 1898, when the proclamation of a republic marked the Filipinos as the first Asian people to try to throw off European colonial rule, the Philippine Archipelago was incorporated into the so-called Spanish colonial empire.\n",
            "\n",
            "For over three hundred years, the policy of the Spanish colonial administration was more economic than political, designed to exploit the region's rich natural resources. As such, the colonial administration of the Philippines, like that of Spanish colonies in Latin America, aimed at supporting the mother state with wealth from colonies through conquest, commerce and trade. In the Philippine Archipelago, the Manila-based Spanish colonial government took complete control of all affairs relating to economic life, in order to secure a perfect monopoly of trade and commerce. It exploited the fertile soil for commercial agricultural products such as tobacco and coffee and implemented a system of oppressive taxation to raise revenue.\n",
            "\n",
            "Therefore, all the colonial laws and regulations were made to control trade, commerce, agriculture, finance, taxation, the foundation of municipalities, the management of the natives, the control of mines, etc. By contrast, the Spanish in the Philippines did not achieve much progress concerning political affairs, creating a loose colonial administration instead of a strong centralized government.\n",
            "\n",
            "Within such a regime, the Spanish did not have a clear and precise understanding of the size and border of their colonial territory. Regarding the features in the South China Sea including the Scarborough Shoal and Spratly Islands, no convincing documents have proved the Spanish seized them. There are at least two reasons for explanation.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, a strong focus on economic benefits meant that the Spanish colonial government had no interest in offshore islands which were uninhabited and of no economic importance. Second, the establishment of a central authority in the colonies was a burden on Spain. It was thus impossible for the Spanish to waste limited resources to seize and occupy islands in the South China Sea.\n",
            "\n",
            "That's also why when the US and Spain concluded their treaty in 1898, the officials of US government held different opinions concerning the territories for cession since even the Spanish themselves did not have a comprehensive understanding of the size of their colony.\n",

            "The 1734 Murillo Velarde map is unacceptable as uncorroborated evidence\n",
            "\n",
            "The 1734 Murillo Velarde Map (also known as Carta Hydrographica Y Chorographica de las Yslas Filipinas) has been used by the Philippine government on various occasions as a historical evidence to support its claim to Scarborough shoal. Based on details on the map, the Philippine government deems that the shoal named Panacot (or Masinloc on other maps) lying to the west coast of Luzon Island is Scarborough Shoal.\n",
            "\n",
            "Such an assertion has already been criticized and corrected by academia. This is not only because there are very few ancient maps supporting this conclusion, but because plenty more maps since the late 18th century clearly indicate that Scarborough Shoal is not Panacot.\n",
            "\n",
            "Panacot and two shoals appear for the first time on a map in 1590, when the Portuguese cartographer Bartolomeu Lasso made a chart of the coastal seas of South and Southeast Asia. He drew a group of three shoals to the west coast of Luzon Island, as his contemporary navigators thought that this region was dangerous for navigation.\n",
            "\n",
            "From the eighteenth century onwards, the British and Spanish conducted several surveys in these waters and confirmed that the three shoals did not exist in reality. They eventually discovered the real Scarborough Shoal and confirmed its true geographical position. Such a geographical discovery proves that Panocat is not Scarborough Shoal and the 1734 map is not reliable.\n",
            "\n",
            "The progress of surveys was reflected by numerous maps published in the late 18th and 19th centuries. For instance, in 1775, the French navigator Jean Baptist Nicholas D. de Mannevillette published his Neptune Oreintal (Second Edition) in Paris, in which A Chart of the China Sea originally drawn by British cartographer Alexander Dalrymple was included. On the chart, the \"Scarboro\" was for the first time marked to the west of the group of three shoals. The co-appearance of Scarborough and Panocot again disproves the Philippine assertion that Scarborough Shoal is Panocot and historically belongs to the Philippines.\n",
            "\n",
            "A part of the A Chart of the China Sea shows the co-existence of the Scarborough Shoal and the group of three shoals to the west coast of Luzon Island.\n",
            "\n",
            "A part of the A Chart of the China Sea shows the co-existence of the Scarborough Shoal and the group of three shoals to the west coast of Luzon Island.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Treaty of Paris and Treaty of Washington do not refer to the Scarborough Shoal and Spratly Islands\n",
            "\n",
            "Scarborough Shoal lies around 230 kilometers to the west of coast of Luzon Island. The Spanish did not know its precise position until the late 18th century. Considering they were of no economic importance and were uninhabitable, the Spanish colonial government had no reason to incorporate it and Spratly Islands into its colonial territory. This explains why the 1898 Treaty of Paris and 1900 Treaty of Washington between Spain and the United States have no words on Scarborough Shoal or the Spratly Islands.\n",
            "\n",
            "Justice Carpio and many other Philippine officials have frequently quoted the Treaty of Washington which states that \"any islands belonging to the Philippine archipelago, lying outside the lines…as if they had been expressly included within those lines\", as a historical evidence to claim the Scarborough Shoal and Spratly Islands which lie beyond the lines defined by the Treaty of Paris. It is necessary to point out that the Philippine quotation is incomplete. The following sentence \"and particularly to the islands of Cagayan, Sulu and Sibutu and their dependencies\" provides additional information explaining which islands lie outside the lines belonged to the Philippine Archipelago. It is thus evident that the Scarborough Shoal and Spratly Islands were not part of the territory ceded to the US, because they had been never part of Spanish colonial empire as discussed above.\n",
            "\n",
            "That is also why when the French illegally occupied nine islands in the South China Sea in 1933, the Philippine ex-Senator Isabelo de los Reyes noticed and wrote a letter to the Governor General William Francis Murphy to take measures to claim the islands. The letter was forwarded to the War Department which held a cautious attitude as the US thought there was no basis for such a claim.\n",
            "\n",
            "Various historical evidence supports China's legal claim to the Scarborough Shoal and Spratly Islands.\n",
            "\n",
            "Contrary to the fake and weak historical evidence supporting the Philippines' claim to Scarborough Shoal and Spratly Island, China has plenty of historical documentary and archaeological evidence to confirm China's historical authority over these islands.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, Chinese official and private historical records, document, maps, charts and other types of evidence show Chinese expeditions in the South China Sea as early as the Han Dynasty (206 BC - 220 AD). These historical sources, such as Yi Wu Zhi (Records of Rarities), Chufan Chi, and the official chronicles of each dynasty, also record Chinese activities in the South China Sea, including the naming the features, navigation and commerce in the sea, jurisdiction over the islands, etc.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the 20th century, the Republic of China government entrusted administration of the South China Sea to the local government in Hainan, which was a special prefecture within Guangdong Province until April 1988 when it was \"upgraded\" to the status of a province. The Republic of China continued to exercise authority over the South China Sea islands through such means as granting licenses or contracts to private Chinese merchants for the development and exploitation of guano and other natural resources on the islands in the South China Sea. Official and non-official maps published in the Republic era invariably include the Spratly Islands as Chinese territory.\n",
            "\n",
            "Third, folk literature, such as Geng Lu Bu (manual of sea routes created by Chinese fishermen) record navigation and fishery activities by Chinese people dating back 600 years. These people sailed to and through the Spratly Islands smoothly, gave names to the features according to their common knowledge, and fished in the region. All these indicate their acquaintance with the Spratly Islands, which could not be obtained without lasting and consistent practice.\n",
            "\n",
            "Fourth, archaeological discoveries demonstrate China's historical ties to the South China Sea. Temples, coins, wells and other traces of Chinese living activities have been discovery on the islands in the South China Sea. Archaeological excavation of shipwreck sites in the South China Sea also prove continual Chinese commercial and shipping activities.\n",
            "\n",
            "Fifth, China's sailing, exploration, and exploitation experience in the South China Sea is richly recorded in the historical sources of various Western countries, including the archives of colonial governments and trading companies to personal records such as travel accounts, navigation logs, etc. For instance, in the 17th and 18th centuries, European commercial companies relied on Chinese traditional sailing routes and trading networks when navigating the waters and conducting commerce in Asia. John Crawfurd, a Scottish colonial administrator and diplomat in the 1830s observed Chinese mariners sailing through the South China Sea to Batavia (now Jakarta), indicating the Spratly Islands was historically known to Chinese mariners.\n",
            "\n",
            "A short conclusion\n",
            "\n",
            "The continua Chinese activities since ancient times have confirmed China's consistent administration and exploitation of the South China Sea resources. Such historical-truth based practice by Chinese government and people became the historical basis for the nine-dashed line, which legally sets forth China's historic title over the South China Sea. Such solid historical foundation cannot be eroded and shaken by the historical fictions of people like Justice Carpio.\n",
